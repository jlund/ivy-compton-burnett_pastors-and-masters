## Chapter I

{7}“Well, this is a nice thing! A nice thing this
schoolmastering! Up at seven, and in a room with
a black fire...I should have thought it might
have occurred to one out of forty boys to poke
it...and hard at work, before other men think it time to
be awake! And while you are about it, don’t pile
on as much coal as it would take the day’s profits
of the school to pay for. And here is a thing I
have to see every morning of my life! Here is a
thing I have to be degraded by, every morning when
I come down to an honest day’s work, a middle-aged
man working to support his family! I am surprised
to see people with such a want of self-respect. I
admit that I am. I would rather see a boy come in
roundly late, than slip in on the stroke, half dressed
and half asleep, and pass as being in time. It is
an ungentlemanly thing to do.”

Mr. Merry, a tall, thin man about fifty, leaned
back in his chair, and fixed on his pupils his little,
pale, screwed up eyes, to which he had the gift
of imparting an alluring kindness. His feelings
{8}towards them, affection, disgust, pride and despair,
seemed to oust each other over his face.

“Yes, I am sick and tired of this sort of thing.
I will not mince matters with you. And get to your
seats without upsetting everything on your way, will
you please? Oh, who would be a schoolmaster? I
should not be doing my duty to you all, if I did not
warn you all against it. And I suppose it is a good
thing to have the east wind from an east window
blowing in upon forty people, thirty-nine of them
growing boys, before their breakfast on a March
morning? And...one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven...it takes eleven boys to shut a
window, does it? And I suppose I cannot make a
few remarks, without having you all fidgetting and
gaping, and behaving like a set of clodhoppers
instead of gentlemen? Get to your work at once;
and don’t look up again before the gong.”

Mr. Merry gave a gesture of despairing
acquiescence, as the boys obeyed this summons without
his endorsing it. He followed them down to their
basement dining-room.

Mrs. Merry, a smooth-headed, mild-looking
woman with a grieved expression, was standing at
the head of a long table, pouring out tea. Her four
little girls were seated near her. A thin dark lady
of forty, matron and teacher of music and French,
was cutting bread.

“Well, Mother,” said Mr. Merry, in the tone of
a tender husband and tried man.

“Well, dear,” said Mrs. Merry, without raising
her eyes.

{9}“Good morning, Miss Basden,” said Mr. Merry,
with the almost exaggerated courtesy due to a lady
he employed.

“Good morning, Mr. Merry,” said Miss Basden,
in a tone in which equality, respect, and absorption
in her duty were rather remarkably mingled.

“Now, look here,” said Mr. Merry, “I have
never had such an ungentlemanly set of boys.
Now, go out again, all of you, and come in like
gentlemen meeting a lady for the first time in the
day.”

A retirement from the room was succeeeded by a
chorus of “Good morning, Mrs. Merry.”

“Good morning, boys,” said Mrs. Merry.

“Have you all met Miss Basden already to-day?”
Mr. Merry inquired, looking round frigidly.

“Good morning, Miss Basden.”

“Good morning, boys,” said Miss Basden, in a
casual tone, still cutting.

“Hillman!” said Mr. Merry. “How often am
I to say that I will not have sitting down before
grace is said? Pray do not show your nature to the
rest of us.”

Hillman gained his feet.

“For these and all other mercies may we be given
thankful hearts,” said Mr. Merry, his eyes taking
a covert general survey.

“Johnson, I am disgusted! I am more. I
cannot tell you before ladies what I think of you. I
hoped I should never have a boy in my school who
would not control himself for a moment to give his
attention to sacred things. What was it, pray, that
{10}you had to say, of such importance that it could not
wait for a second?”

Johnson, who had been observing that it was wise
to ask for thankful hearts for such mercies, was
silent.

“Now,” said Mr. Merry, preparing again to bend
his head, “we will say grace again, and I hope
nothing so humiliating will occur a second time.
I shall not speak of the matter, Johnson.”

Mrs. Merry and Miss Basden bowed their heads
a little lower than before, though it was hardly to
be thought that their experience had not been suitable.

“I cannot bear to see a sulky boy,” said
Mr. Merry, throwing a disgusted glance at Johnson.

“Will you have tea or coffee, dear?” said
Mrs. Merry.

“Oh, either, either; anything will do for me.”

“I always arrange for you to have your choice,
dear.”

“Yes, Mother; yes. You take good care of me.
You spend your life taking care of people, I am
afraid.” Mr. Merry looked round on the boys with
an air of rebuking ingratitude.

“Yes, I have done a good deal of taking care
in my time. I think I have done very little else.”

“Well, Mrs. Merry, we must begin to take care
of you,” said Miss Basden, putting the toast rack
near to Mrs. Merry.

“How did you sleep, Miss Basden?” said
Mr. Merry, in an extremely interested manner.

“Mrs. Merry,” Miss Basden said, in a rather
high monotone, “the boys are saying that the
{11}marmalade is watery. I am telling them that
no water is used in marmalade, that marmalade
does not contain water; so I do not see how it
can be.”

“I do not see how it can be, either; but of course
I wish to be told if anything is not as nice as it
can be. Let me taste the marmalade.”

Miss Basden offered a spoon from the pot.

“It seems to me that it is very nice. Perhaps
I am not a judge of marmalade. I do not care to
eat it on bread with butter myself. One or the other
is enough for me. But it seems to me to be very
nice.”

“Mother, don’t water the boys’ preserves,” said
Mr. Merry, nodding his head up and down.
“Don’t try to make things go further than they
will go, you know. The game isn’t worth the
candle.”

“I do not understand you, dear. There is never
any extra water in preserves. They would not keep
if they had water in them. There would not be any
object in it. It would be less economical, not more.”

“Oh, well, Mother, I don’t know anything about
the kitchen business and that. But if the marmalade
is not right, let us have it right another time. That
is all I mean.”

“I do not think you know what you mean, dear.”

“No, Mother, no; very likely I don’t.”

“The housekeeping is not your province, Mr.
Merry,” said Miss Basden. “You will have us
coming and telling you how to teach Latin, if you are
not careful.”

{12}“Ah, Miss Basden, ah, you saucy lady! Not
such a babel down at that part of the room! Not
such a babel. Do you hear me? Be quiet, or
go away, and leave the room to civilized people.”
Mr. Merry looked fiercely towards the other end of
the table, which certainly tended to be the noisier.

“Mr. Burgess is not going to allow us much of his
company at breakfast this morning,” said Miss
Basden.

“I wonder if Fanny called him,” said Mrs. Merry.

“Yes, she called him,” said Miss Basden.

“Ah! he’s fond of the sheets, is Mr. Burgess.
He is fond of the sheets,” said Mr. Merry; while the
boys found this talk of the under-master a cause for
nudges and smiles.

“I never can understand how people can lie in bed
in daylight,” said Miss Basden.

“Now it would do you good to do a little more of
it, Miss Basden,” said Mr. Merry. “You do too
much of the other thing, as I always tell you. It
would do you good to do a little more of it.”

“Oh, that sort of advice does not have much effect
on me, Mr. Merry,” said Miss Basden, again cutting
bread.

“You give poor Miss Basden a great deal of work
to do,” said Mr. Merry, looking down the rows of
boys with vague disapproval.

“You must make haste, all of you. Mr. Herrick
will be here to read prayers in a minute,” said
Mrs. Merry.

“Mother, ought not Mr. Burgess’ bacon to be
kept hot?” said Mr. Merry, his voice conveying
{13}criticism of Mr. Burgess, and the need of diplomacy
with him.

“We do not usually expect people to come down
when breakfast is over,” said Mrs. Merry. “The
bacon was hot when it was brought in.”

“Fanny,” said Mr. Merry, in a tone of apology
to the maid who was waiting, “just put Mr.
Burgess’ bacon down in the fender, will you?
Thank you, Fanny, very much.”

“I do not like more bread cut than will be eaten,”
said Mrs. Merry.

“Mrs. Merry, several boys asked for some more
only a minute ago,” said Miss Basden.

“If you asked for it, eat it,” said Mr. Merry. “If
you asked for it, eat it. Do not give the trouble of
cutting it, and then cause more disturbance by
refusing it. If you have eaten all the rest, you can
easily manage a little more.”

As the chairs were pushed from the table, Mr.
Herrick entered. He was the actual owner of the
school, Mr. Merry being his partner. He was a
short, impressive old man with a solid neck and head,
heavy grey hair, and features with a touch of the
Jew. He was a writer, and kept his time for his
own, and read prayers to the school by way of acting
as its head. He had placed his school in the old
university town, to be near the college where he had
spent his youth. Mr. Merry stood out in the room,
half bowing towards him.

“Good morning, Mr. Herrick, good morning. It
is a frosty day. That is why we are a little late.
Frost makes good appetites; that is one good thing
{14}that it does. We were just going to get up from
the table, when there was a demand for more bread
and butter. By no means the first demand, eh,
boys?”

The boys signified amongst themselves their sense
of the doubleness of Mr. Merry’s nature. Mr.
Herrick half bowed in his turn to Mr. Merry, quite
bowed to Mrs. Merry, and again to Miss Basden;
nodded to the boys, and sat down and opened the
Bible. As he did so, there appeared Mr. Burgess,
who walked into the room with an air of being
unconscious that he would not find things at a
natural stage for a new-comer.

“Ah, Mr. Burgess,” said Mr. Merry, as Mr.
Burgess’ eyes began to take in that matters had gone
so far; “we have been talking about you. The only
thing we could do, as we could not talk to you.
There is a place that is very comfortable on a frosty
morning. Eh?”

Mr. Merry’s way of addressing his head and
his junior for the ears of the boys, had grown to a
habit.

“Am I late?” said Mr. Burgess, in a casual,
courteous tone.

“Good morning, Burgess,” said Herrick, his eyes
on his book.

Mr. Merry sat down.

Mr. Burgess, as just perceiving that prayers were
about to be held, took his seat.

“Pray do not allow us to keep you waiting for
breakfast, Burgess,” said Herrick. “Take your
seat at the table, I beg of you.”

{15}“Oh no, Mr. Herrick. I shall like to...take
my part with you as usual, thank you. It matters
very little to me what time I breakfast. Often I am
out of doors for an hour or two before. I have very
little sense of time in the morning.”

There was a titter from the boys.

“Yes, Mr. Herrick,” said Mr. Merry, with an air
of apology, and a fierce sidelong glance; “he goes
out sometimes before breakfast to get his exercise, you
know. Young fellows always will be thinking of
keeping fit, you know.”

“Mr. Burgess will have to take out the boys this
morning, Mr. Merry,” said Miss Basden, leaning
forward.

Mr. Burgess sat with an air exclusively expectant
of Herrick’s reading. He greatly disliked Miss
Basden, though there was a belief among the boys
that he designed to wed her. Herrick began to read,
and Miss Basden listened with colour deepened, and
Mr. Burgess with an appearance of attentive interest.
When the assembly rose from its knees, Herrick at
once bore the Bible from the room. Mr. Burgess
stepped to the window, and sought the signs of the
sky.

“Come, now, Mr. Burgess,” said Mr. Merry,
making amends to his junior by lifting his bacon
himself from the fender. “If you are not hungry
by this time, you should be. Pray do not hurry.
The boys will not hurt by a little waiting.”

“Oh, thank you, Mr. Merry,” said Mr Burgess,
coming to the table, and taking up the sugar tongs.
“I had no idea of the time. But boys do not hurt
{16}by a little waiting; that is true. Adams, just see if
my paper is in the hall.”

Adams obeyed with a feeling of respect for
Mr. Burgess, which Mr. Merry was almost disposed
to share. Mr. Burgess received his paper, and put
down his fork to turn to its pages. Mr. Merry
inquired if the boys were waiting for their footman
to bring them their boots.

Mr. Burgess, left to himself, set to his breakfast
with an energy he had not shown that day, except
at his toilet. Even if boys did hurt by waiting, these
would not have suffered. He put his paper in his
pocket, and at a distance from the house began to
read. Returning, he saw Mr. Merry at a window.
He looked back at the paper, and in a moment turned
to a boy and said: “So you see, Parliament thought
that Bill a wrong one, and it was thrown out.”

“Well, what news, Mr. Burgess?” said Mr.
Merry, coming into the hall.

“Oh, nothing to speak of. Just a few little things
to glance at,” said Mr. Burgess, defining the scope
of his attention. “Would you care to have the
paper, Mr. Merry?”

“Thank you, Mr. Burgess, thank you. I am a
poor man. I don’t rise to the *Times*.”

Mr. Burgess went without a word to the class-room
where the elder pupils were taught. Mr. Merry
shuffled into the other, and sat down before the
younger boys. He had not been prompted to the
teacher’s life by his liberal education. There were
other and more urgent reasons for his choice.

Mrs. Merry taught the scripture of the school, and
{17}there was a general sense of her fitness for the task,
based upon her temperament rather than her
scholarship. Mr. Merry often mentioned the fact of her
teaching it to parents.

The boys, who had a tendency to giggle this
morning, took their seats about her table.

“It is the scripture lesson,” she said, with
peaceful lips. “I think we are forgetting that.”

The boys read aloud a chapter verse by verse, and
Mrs. Merry added observations, in a gentle, rather
peculiar voice used only on these occasions. At
questions she turned to the commentary, and read it
out; and it was felt that difficulties had been met as
far as reverence permitted. An especial discrepancy
caused an increase of mirth. Mrs. Merry looked
straight at the questioner.

“I don’t think we will cavil about it, Johnson.
We will just think of it. That will be the best, and
the most difficult thing. The book says nothing,
you see.”

It was felt that a cheap effort had been made; but
the laughter held its own.

Mrs. Merry looked very long at a boy.

“It is only the Bible, Bentley; only the most
sacred book in existence that you are
laughing at.”

“It is only the Bible, Bentley.”

“I shall have to give you up, boys.”

Mrs. Merry, with a look round that said many
things, rose and walked from the room.

“Constant laughing and inattention make it
impossible to teach them!”

{18}Mr. Merry entered, hunching his shoulders and
driving his hands violently into his pockets.

“Well, now, I am degraded. *I* am degraded. I
feel it a personal humiliation to have to come and
speak to people supposed to be gentlemen, about
their making it impossible for a lady to teach them.
For a lady to teach them scripture! For a lady to
teach them holy things! There is an unspeakable
thing to find happening in my school. I shall not
speak of it. I cannot bring myself to do so. And
I hope that no boy in this room will speak to me
again to-day. Because I could not come down to his
level, and there is the truth for him.”

It was Mrs. Merry’s birthday, and she knew that
a present from the boys would be placed on the table
at tea. It had been subscribed for by them in private
consultation with Miss Basden, and chosen by that
lady and Mrs. Merry in the town together.

By tea time Mrs. Merry had reached the state,
which justified her yearly message, that she was
prevented by a headache from appearing. The boys
begged Miss Basden to approach her. Mr. Merry
sat vaguely ill at ease, kept as it were in bands by
the parcel at the head of the table.

Mrs. Merry sent word that she would try and come
for a moment; and entered, flushed and unexpectant,
and approached her place.

“Why, what is this? What can this be? Why,
I do not understand this, bovs.”

Miss Basden stepped forward and quickly cut the
string, in the manner of one tying gunpowder to a
friend at the stake.

{19}“Oh, boys,” said Mrs. Merry. “Oh, boys!
Oh, what is this? Oh, you should not spend your
money on me. I had no expectation of anything
like this. And the very thing that I needed! Some
good fairy must have...”

Her voice failed.

“There, Mother, there, you’re not well,” said
Mr. Merry. “You’re not well, as you told us,
Mother. And so you get upset. We know how it
is. It is just because you look after us all too well.
We know how pleased you are. So you need not
trouble to tell us any more. Come, have your tea,
boys. Have your tea, and it is very kind of you
all. What is that commotion in the hall above?
Williams, just see what the commotion in the hall is.
Thank you, Williams, very much.”

It was reported that a lady was in the hall, and
that Mr. Herrick requested that Mr. Merry would
join him.

“What a time to come to see a school! After
keeping myself free from seven in the morning, I am
not allowed to have a cup of tea in peace. People
will be coming in the middle of the night next.
If there’s a thing I can’t bear, it’s want of
consideration.”

Mr. Merry hastened up the stairs, and at the top
caused his face to undergo a change, preparatory to
whatever final one might be expedient.

“Oh, this is Mr. Merry! What a shame to call
him away from his boys! But I can only stay a
moment, so I shall not keep him.”

“Now, what a thing to be saying of me!” said
{20}Mr. Merry, taking the stranger’s hand in both of his,
with fond eyes. “What a thing to be saying of me!
That I should think it a shame to be called away to
you. Not but what I am fond of my boys. Yes, I
am fond of my boys.”

“I saw such a dear little boy in the hall.”

“Ah, the little rascal! Little mischief that he is,
always running about, when he ought to be at his
books! Ah, well, they like a run from time to time.
And he is not over strong, the little fellow. When
he came to us, it went to my heart to see him. But
my wife, she coddles him, you know. She coddles
him, and he is a different boy.”

“Oh, how nice for an anxious mother to hear!
Because we can’t expect Mr. Herrick to give his mind
to all the little things a mother thinks of.”

“Oh, we won’t tell Mr. Herrick what we think of
him,” said Mr. Merry, as his chief followed his
custom of leaving him unhampered play for his gifts.
“Perhaps he knows without our telling him.
Sometimes I see him reading all about himself in the
papers.”

“And about the general teaching of the school?
Mr. Herrick does not do a great deal of the ordinary
work, does he?” Mr. Merry reflected that Herrick
had gone far in the minutes before his release.
“But of course you have masters to help you?”

“Now, I tell you a thing,” said Mr. Merry, lifting
his questioner’s hand up and down, a picture of Mr.
Burgess before his eyes. “You have confidence in
us. In me and my wife, and my good helpers; and
above all, in your boy. And there is one of us you
{21}won’t be disappointed in. I can promise you that.
And that is the last. And the first too, isn’t he?
Bless him, yes. And now there is a thing I want
to say. I am here to make the boys happy. Little
fellows away from home need to be made happy, you
know. A master who is known all over the world
is an enormous thing for a boy. I wish I had had
as much in my young days. But that is not quite
all that is wanted. A mother knows that.”

On his way back through the hall Mr. Merry
passed Mr. Herrick without a word. The quality of
Mr. Merry’s that gained him his bread was never
alluded to between them.

“Well, there is another one come and gone,
Mother. Another ship in the night. One never
knows if anything will come of it. And a third of
what comes out of one more boy won’t overflow our
coffers, will it?”

There was a titter from the boys.

“You get on with your tea,” said Mr. Merry.
“And don’t be so humiliatingly deceived as to think
that another one of you would be of any advantage
to anyone. Because such an idea would be
humiliating to you. I can tell you that.”

“I do not think I could do with another boy,” said
Mrs. Merry, in a gentle, distinct tone.

“No, I should not like you to have anything more
on you, Mrs. Merry,” said Miss Basden.

“I don’t know that I could either,” said Mr
Burgess.

“Oh well, Mr. Burgess, it wouldn’t be too much
on you,” said Mr. Merry. “We should see to that.
{22}It would be all fitting in together for you, you
know.”

Mr. Burgess looked towards the window.

“I could always do with what had to be done
with,” said Miss Basden. “But the boys are quite
mistaken, if they think that is any indication that
they are needed by anyone. It is they who do the
needing, I think.”

“Yes, Miss Basden,” said Mr. Merry, nodding
his head. “It is indeed. They who do the
needing! I should think so. I should be glad to
be told of something they don’t need. Because I
don’t know of anything, and that is the truth. I
have just been hearing what is good enough for
them. And I don’t see anything about them that
seems to call for it. I don’t, indeed.”

## Chapter II

{23}“This is a good room to come back to,” said
Herrick. “That hall and the woman, and poor
Merry shuffling up to do his duty! It made me
shiver.”

“The sight of duty does make one shiver,” said
Miss Herrick. “The actual doing of it would kill
one, I think.”

Emily Herrick was a tall, dark woman of fifty,
half-sister to Herrick, with a face that somehow
recalled an attractive idol’s, iron-grey hair wound in
plaits about her head, and a quick, deep voice.

“Merry knows what the duty is,” said Herrick.
“For my life, I don’t.”

“One couldn’t know what that duty was,” said
Miss Herrick. “It could only be felt, and perhaps
you have too good a brain to do things in that way.”

“Let us leave it at that,” said Herrick.

“To think that you made the school!” said
Emily. “For it was you who made it. But of
course you would do the creative part.”

“Yes, yes. And I could go on with it,” said
Herrick.

“Of course you could,” said Emily. “Wouldn’t
it be dreadful if you had to? Or if you did? It is
almost dreadful that you could.”

“Yes, yes, it is,” said Herrick. “I am an
ordinary man.”

{24}“I didn’t mean that, darling,” said Emily.
“They say that teachers are born, not made. I know
that schoolmasters are. And it was for a schoolmaster
that we wanted Mr. Merry.”

“It is for a schoolmaster we have him, anyhow,”
said Herrick, sitting down at his desk.

“We must get out of the way of talking as if we
were not honest, Nicholas,” said Emily. “Anyone
dishonest beside Mr. Merry would be such a waste,
and wastefulness in a school is so unwise. And
Mr. Merry has such charm in all that he does.”

“Merry is as open as the day,” said Herrick.

“Of course,” said Emily. “That is what I
meant. What charm could there be in dishonesty
apart from that? Ought you to write any more
to-day, dear? You have written more than usual,
after being up all night.”

“I must go on separating my papers from old
Crabbe’s,” said Herrick. “I found some things of
his to go through, and I took some of my own to
deal with. I knew it would be a long night. And
he did not want much looking to, poor old Crabbe!
Eighty-nine if he was a day, and a long sinking, as
if he were not done out enough to die! He did not
suffer, or hardly, and Masson and Bumpus and I
watched by him at the end. Well, may we all do
as well, die at ninety, easily, and with our friends
round us. I had rather have friends than children.
Men with the same outlook, not people looking for
their main spell after we are gone! Well, Emily,
I hope you will watch by me one day, as I watched
by my old friend last night.”

{25}“How beautifully you speak, darling!” said
Emily, putting up her glass to look at her brother.
“And what a lot of good you have done! But I
don’t think you have made very kind plans for me.
But perhaps you have left my deathbed to Mr.
Merry. There is no reason why he shouldn’t take
all your responsibilities. And to carry out your
scheme for yourself for an outsider, is very rare of
you. It could hardly be expected for one of your
own family.”

“Ah, Emily,” said Herrick. “You are twenty
years younger than me. That is a thing we don’t
reckon with, but it is there. You don’t look back or
forward yet. We can’t look forward really; but I
think I can look back, and see my life as not
lacking.”

Herrick lived in his disappointment that in letters
he had done only critical work.

“I never look back on my life,” said Emily.
“It seems to be lacking in too much. You are so
brave. There are William and Richard coming in.
Guests must not be torn between admiration and
anxiety, like people in the house.”

William Masson was a tall, large man in late
middle age, with loose limbs and loose clothes, and
a weather-beaten, high-boned face. He seemed an
example of all the uneasinesses combined into ease.

His companion was a little, dark man about
fifty-six, with eyes sunk deeply in a working face.

The two were Fellows and dons at Herrick’s
college, and had meant romance for each other in
youth. They had watched with Herrick at the
{26}deathbed of an old don, who had outlived his
friends.

“Well, well,” said Herrick, “so he is gone, the
old man! We shall all be in his place one day. I
am fortunate in having you all younger than me. I
have not to think of dying, surrounded by no one
who is of my own kind and age. I can’t help being
glad that it is I who will have to look to you at
the end, and not you to me.”

“He has been explaining to me,” said Emily,
“how I must die, unattended, while he has
everybody kept alive for him. Nicholas has a wonderful
gift for getting the best out of others. Think of
Mr. Merry.”

“I never cease to revere you for that, Herrick,”
said Bumpus.

“I don’t really revere Nicholas so much as Mr.
Merry,” said Emily. “At least, I don’t know. It
was wonderful of Nicholas. I thought it mattered
about Mr. Merry’s not being educated, as we were
having him for a schoolmaster.”

“Yes, yes,” said Masson, in his high,
stammering voice. “I confess I rather thought that.”

“I did not think that,” said Bumpus. “But I
didn’t know what did mattter. The thing Merry
has, isn’t a thing one could guess.”

“Well, I always trust myself to judge a person at
sight,” said Herrick. “It is borne in upon me how
a person is this or that. And I never find myself
wrong. It is a gift that we are either with or
without.”

“I believe gifts are like that,” said Bumpus.

{27}“That is unkind, Dickie,” said Emily.

“You may have to see us all out, Herrick,” said
Bumpus. “You are past the danger age.”

“It is true that people who live to be seventy
often do live to a great age,” said Herrick. “They
are in a sense out of danger.”

“I believe you seem to be planning my death,”
said Emily, “and without any arrangements at all for
my deathbed. I hope you really do trust Mr. Merry.
Not only with the kind of trust that does for boys.”

“I am sixty,” said Masson. “I claim also to
be out of danger.”

“How exacting you all are about your amount of
life!” said Bumpus. “But of course we are all of
us too good to die.”

“Well, well, we shall go on, doing things it has
been in us to do here, that we have not done,” said
Herrick. “Ah, you do not think so, Emily. But
this modern thought has you in its grip. You will
grow out of it.”

“That will be nice and flexible of me, to grow out
of things at fifty. They say that unusual people do
develope very late.”

“I can’t understand how people fear death,” said
Herrick. “It seems to me the most usual, natural
thing, the last thing to be feared.”

“It is very usual. It might even be called
universal,” said Bumpus.

“Don’t be shallow and witty, Dickie,” said
Emily. “Nicholas was speaking of deeper truth.”

“I don’t find anything shocking in seeing death
ahead for me,” said Masson.

{28}“No, you see it as it is, and yourself as you are,”
said Bumpus. “You are a long way above and
below the rest of us. Below is the wrong word.”

“I should have thought he was above
everything,” said Emily. “I never like to think of it for
him. It must be so hard to be like that. We are
very brave to be able to talk about death. As brave
as people who feel able to make their wills.”

“I always wondered why Crabbe never wrote,”
said Herrick. “He should have, shouldn’t he?
Shouldn’t he now have written?”

“He never did. Not a line,” said Bumpus.

“I suppose a search after anything would be no
good? I came across two or three scraps of different
things. They are over there with my papers. But
nothing of use.”

“No, no, no,” said Masson, firmly for him. “A
search for anything would be no good. He had
nothing. He kept nothing. He was as light as air.
He had no friends but ourselves. No
contemporaries outliving him. There seems to be no one
to be notified of his death.”

“That is how Nicholas wants me to be,” said
Emily.

“Ah!” said Herrick.

“He has died as he lived,” went on Masson.
“Keeping nothing, needing nothing, asking nothing.
A search of his rooms would be like searching a
field.”

“You ought to write, William,” said Emily.
“You really have written, after saying things like
that.”

{29}“I have been thinking of writing again,” said
Bumpus, putting his hand over his eyes. “But I
expect you all forget that I ever wrote. I don’t know
if you do remember how dramatic I was once as a
youth, when—natural and reasonable it seemed to
me then—I caused a manuscript to be put into the
grave of a friend? I have written nothing since.
I didn’t mean that his death prevented me from
writing later. That sort of thing comes out, if it is
there. Though it is astonishing how many of us
are capable of a single thing. But I have been
writing a little book lately. I don’t know why I
should say little, except that it is short.”

“This is good to hear, Richard,” said Masson.

“Too good,” said Emily. “I am so jealous for
Nicholas. And he hasn’t a story in his life, either.
I mean, not a beautiful story.”

“I seem as if I must still write like a boy,” said
Bumpus, more freely and eagerly. “I find myself
having to prune and tighten and mature. I don’t
know if it is breaking off in youth that makes me go
on as if from where I left off. I don’t believe we are
ever much farther than at twenty-five.”

“I don’t think I am,” said Herrick. “For I
also am thinking of bringing out a little book soon.
Yes, Emily, you may look at me through that glass.
I put off telling you until I should have the
countenance of friends. For pleading guilty to turning
real author at seventy! So we coincide, Bumpus.
But I wish our ages coincided.”

“This is surely coincidence enough,” said
Bumpus.

{30}“I don’t wish anything more,” said Emily.
“And how wonderful we are to have you coincide!
It is selfless and beautiful of William and me.”

“That is what I feel,” said Bumpus.

“And I also am pleased with my little book,”
went on Herrick, taking his sister’s hand, “and
also don’t know why I call it little, except that it is
short. Short it is, and that’s the truth; though I
don’t know why we should prefer a long book. If
a book is a whole in itself, why is its length any
matter?”

“But you do prefer a long one, darling,” said
Emily. “I always like that side of you. And now
I know it is the simplicity of greatness. But don’t
make the book any longer. It is so careless of
popular opinion to leave it short.”

“I wish...I wonder why we give voice to
these wishes; but I wish old Crabbe had lived to see
you with a book written, Herrick,” said Masson.
“He always said that you were a man who would
write, if you put yourself to it.”

“Just what Nicholas has been saying of him,”
said Emily. “How beautiful they both are!”

“I have been a long fool, idle through seventy
years of a good life,” said Herrick. “But I don’t
know that I can wish that about Crabbe. I feel as if
I should not have written this book, apart from his
death; as if it would not have shaped itself in my
mind as I now feel it. Of course there is no
connection. None at all. None. But it came to me,
as I sat there, the whole thing, the whole book.
There it was. I can’t explain it.”

{31}“It doesn’t seem good management,” said Emily.
“To keep your book to yourself for seventy years,
and then have Mr. Crabbe die to make it come out.
But you are not a good manager; and Mr. Merry
can’t do more than most of our life for both of us,
and my death. And Mr. Crabbe was ninety, and
you had it all so nice for him.”

“How long will it take you actually to write it,
Herrick?” said Bumpus.

“I have it this time,” said Herrick. “I have
been letting it grow in my head. Because of
course in a way it has been there for some time.
It is as good as written down. It was the form of it
that flashed on me. I do things much in my head,
as you know.”

“Oh, Nicholas, I didn’t know. I do admire
you,” said Emily.

“I think I have found myself at last,” said
Herrick. “I think that, God willing, I shall have
done my little bit for my generation, done what every
man ought to do, before he dies.”

“You don’t really think it is what every man
ought to do,” said Emily. “I do hope it isn’t.”

“Assuming God, you wouldn’t do much if he
wasn’t willing,” said Masson.

Bumpus laughed, and looked almost proudly at
Masson.

“Are we going to be broad and wicked?” said
Emily. “I like that, because I am not very
educated, and so still young in my mind. Really,
it would be nice to have some religion, and not go
on without ever any comfort. And I am not like
{32}Nicholas, who is really God’s equal, and not his child
at all. I think it is better not to have God than to
be like that with him.”

“It is rather empty for him not to be had,” said
Bumpus. “He always seems to me a pathetic
figure, friendless and childless and set up alone in a
miserable way.”

“Yes, he has a touch of William in him,” said
Emily. “But you know he isn’t childless. We
give even our boys more advantages than that.
Mrs. Merry gives it to them.”

“You can have him childless in these days,” said
Bumpus. “But if you have him, I like him really.
I like him not childless, and grasping and fond of
praise. I like the human and family interest.”

“Yes, he tends to be neutral nowadays,” said
Masson. “Perhaps I do resemble him in that.”

“And he had such a personality,” said Emily.
“Such a superior, vindictive and over-indulgent one.
He is one of the best drawn characters in fiction.”

“I really cannot listen to this,” said Herrick.

“Isn’t it quietly conscientious of Herrick, to be
behind the parents’ backs what he is to their faces?”
said Bumpus. “What he would be to their faces if
he saw them.”

“I am deeply grateful to Merry,” said Herrick.
“Nobody knows what seeing them is.”

“Mr. Merry does,” said Emily. “I am not
grateful to him. I am cringing under a load of
obligation. And he is a tragic figure, and haunts me.
Now to Mrs. Merry I am just healthily grateful.
And to Miss Basden my gratitude is quite of a brisk,
{33}employing kind. I almost feel more kindly to Mr.
Burgess, who has to have the opposite of gratitude,
though I never quite know why. Now I must go
and ask Mrs. Merry if we may ask you to stay to
dinner. I always think Nicholas and I carry that off
so well, having to ask permission to have guests.”

“How Emily runs on and on, doesn’t she?” said
Herrick. “Day after day, year after year, the
stream never runs dry.”

“It doesn’t seem that it could,” said Masson;
“that Emily could ever be subject to age.”

“I always wonder if she had any youth,” said
Bumpus, his eyes sweeping over Masson. “She
seems somehow ageless, to have nothing to do with
age.”

“You knew her when she was young,” said
Herrick. “But you were young too, then. She
was wonderfully like what she is now. No, I think
in a sense she had no youth, just as in a way she will
have no old age. She is of that type. A rare
one.”

“I think the two omissions compensate for each
other,” said Masson.

“I do not. I like the whole of experience,” said
Bumpus.

“I always wonder,” went on Herrick, in the tone
of a man who kept back nothing of his heart, “if I
should have been happier or unhappier without her.
I am never bound by convention; and the question
arises in the case of any intimate relationship,
however good. We could all have moulded ourselves
differently.”

{34}“We can’t change the stuff in the mould,” said
Masson.

“And Emily is a woman with a good deal of the
man in her,” said Bumpus.

“Oh, I have had more to do with women than you
two have,” said Herrick. “I am not as much off
the common line. But most of my life’s
relationships have been with men. But that is what I meant.
I wonder what I should have been, if I had not had
Emily. And, William, you are thinking, what would
she have been. But I am never the slave of
convention.”

“Don’t stop,” said Emily, returning. “I like
talk that is unfit for me. It is having to get
used to Nicholas, who is not the slave of
convention, as he says. Fancy being able to say that
truthfully!”

“I believe in the interest of oneself, you know,”
said Herrick, going on as if he had not heard his
sister. “I take the deepest interest in myself, apart
from egotism of personality, though I may have that.
And I have no condemnation for egotists. I think
they are often the higher type.”

“This is not the kind of unfitness I meant,” said
Emily. “It does sound wicked, but not with a
wickedness that I like.”

“I think on the whole they are not,” said Masson.

“You could not be an egotist, William, whether
or no you wanted it,” said Bumpus.

“Surely everybody would want it,” said Emily.
“I am sure it would be dreadful not to be one.
Isn’t it, William?”

{35}“Egotism is a gift, like anything else,” said
Herrick.

“Then I grow prouder and prouder of you,
darling,” said Emily. “An author and an egotist,
and both of them such lovely things.”

“I suppose your book is a novel, Herrick? Mine
is,” said Bumpus.

“Yes, yes. A short novel,” said Herrick. “I
hold no brief for long books, as I say.”

“Real books coming out of our own heads!” said
Bumpus. “And not just printed unkindness to
other people’s.”

“My first original piece of writing!” said
Herrick. “That I should have to say it at seventy!
Not just what Richard has said. Ah, I have felt
that. Not that I have not done good work in that
way. And it all has to be done. But my first book.
Probably my only book, though many would be
surprised to hear me say so. I thrill like a youth at the
thought of seeing it out.”

“Oh, so do I,” said Emily. “But not like a
youth. Though I should love to do that once again.
And it is better and safer at seventy. It will have
to have the respect due to age, anyhow. But I am
afraid Mr. Merry will think it is a story book.
Perhaps we had better keep it from him.”

“He must know about it when it comes out,” said
Masson.

“No, I don’t think Mr. Merry knows about books
when they come out,” said Emily.

Masson and Bumpus returned to the college,
entered Masson’s rooms, and sat for a time in silence.

{36}“Well, William,” said Bumpus, “I have
protested that I have written a book. You must know
that it is your part to seem to want to talk about it.”

“If you would like to talk of it with me,” said
Masson. “I think that men who take only to
science, cannot be on the point enough in these
things to be bearable.”

“I suppose you will not read it,” said Bumpus.
“Or if you do, will not tell me what you think of it.”

“Am—am I of the sort to read it?” said Masson.
“I hesitate, as I say, to inflict the alien touch.”

“It is this that thirty years has brought us to,”
said Bumpus.

“I—I think it is a good thing to come to, to keep
to,” said Masson, his voice going high. “I think
it is the worst thing about intimacy, that it may blunt
every edge.”

“Yes, yes. Edges are the only thing,” said
Bumpus. “It is odd about Herrick, isn’t it? His
writing a book.”

“Odd, is it?” said Masson. “Oughtn’t he to
have written before?”

“That does seem to me the alien touch,” said
Bumpus.

“Well, perhaps it will hardly be a good book,
said Masson.

Bumpus laughed.

“I should have said that Herrick knew too well
for that. He has his hand on his name with great
skill. ‘Oughtn’t he to have written?’ That is
what he has done. I don’t follow. It is certainly
odd how both he and I seem to have come to it
{37}suddenly. It is dwelling on the time when I sacrificed
my other book, that has brought me to it. My mind
has been on it lately. I don’t know why I should
be sensitive about it. My feelings had nothing in
them to be ashamed of. This book seems to start
out of all that, somehow, to go on from it. Well,
there is nothing between.”

“In that way,” said Masson. “You—you feel
deeply about the book, Richard?”

“Yes,” said Bumpus, leaning forward, looking
small and tense and alive. “I have wanted to write
all my life, felt it was this, it was mine to want. And
it seemed not to come to me, after the early time
when things happened as we know. There seems to
be one book in a good many of us. And, of course,
that one book of mine was mine no longer.”

“No, no,” said Masson, not raising his eyes.

“So this means much to me,” said Bumpus,
looking at Masson.

“It—it means then much to me,” said Masson.
“Perhaps Herrick’s book is the one book in him that
is in many of us.”

“No,” said Bumpus, laughing. “I have more
than one in me, and Herrick has not one at all.”

“Then the book must explain itself,” said Masson.

“I believe I am capable of any meanness,” said
Bumpus suddenly, “short of actually cheating
people of their own.”

“Is there much meanness short of some form of
that,” said Masson.

“No, no, none that matters,” said Bumpus.
