{7}## Chapter I

“Well, this is a nice thing! A nice thing this
schoolmastering! Up at seven, and in a room with
a black fire...I should have thought it might
have occurred to one out of forty boys to poke
it...and hard at work, before other men think it time to
be awake! And while you are about it, don’t pile
on as much coal as it would take the day’s profits
of the school to pay for. And here is a thing I
have to see every morning of my life! Here is a
thing I have to be degraded by, every morning when
I come down to an honest day’s work, a middle-aged
man working to support his family! I am surprised
to see people with such a want of self-respect. I
admit that I am. I would rather see a boy come in
roundly late, than slip in on the stroke, half dressed
and half asleep, and pass as being in time. It is
an ungentlemanly thing to do.”

Mr. Merry, a tall, thin man about fifty, leaned
back in his chair, and fixed on his pupils his little,
pale, screwed up eyes, to which he had the gift
of imparting an alluring kindness. His feelings
{8}towards them, affection, disgust, pride and despair,
seemed to oust each other over his face.

“Yes, I am sick and tired of this sort of thing.
I will not mince matters with you. And get to your
seats without upsetting everything on your way, will
you please? Oh, who would be a schoolmaster? I
should not be doing my duty to you all, if I did not
warn you all against it. And I suppose it is a good
thing to have the east wind from an east window
blowing in upon forty people, thirty-nine of them
growing boys, before their breakfast on a March
morning? And...one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven...it takes eleven boys to shut a
window, does it? And I suppose I cannot make a
few remarks, without having you all fidgetting and
gaping, and behaving like a set of clodhoppers
instead of gentlemen? Get to your work at once;
and don’t look up again before the gong.”

Mr. Merry gave a gesture of despairing
acquiescence, as the boys obeyed this summons without
his endorsing it. He followed them down to their
basement dining-room.

Mrs. Merry, a smooth-headed, mild-looking
woman with a grieved expression, was standing at
the head of a long table, pouring out tea. Her four
little girls were seated near her. A thin dark lady
of forty, matron and teacher of music and French,
was cutting bread.

“Well, Mother,” said Mr. Merry, in the tone of
a tender husband and tried man.

“Well, dear,” said Mrs. Merry, without raising
her eyes.

{9}“Good morning, Miss Basden,” said Mr. Merry,
with the almost exaggerated courtesy due to a lady
he employed.

“Good morning, Mr. Merry,” said Miss Basden,
in a tone in which equality, respect, and absorption
in her duty were rather remarkably mingled.

“Now, look here,” said Mr. Merry, “I have
never had such an ungentlemanly set of boys.
Now, go out again, all of you, and come in like
gentlemen meeting a lady for the first time in the
day.”

A retirement from the room was succeeeded by a
chorus of “Good morning, Mrs. Merry.”

“Good morning, boys,” said Mrs. Merry.

“Have you all met Miss Basden already to-day?”
Mr. Merry inquired, looking round frigidly.

“Good morning, Miss Basden.”

“Good morning, boys,” said Miss Basden, in a
casual tone, still cutting.

“Hillman!” said Mr. Merry. “How often am
I to say that I will not have sitting down before
grace is said? Pray do not show your nature to the
rest of us.”

Hillman gained his feet.

“For these and all other mercies may we be given
thankful hearts,” said Mr. Merry, his eyes taking
a covert general survey.

“Johnson, I am disgusted! I am more. I
cannot tell you before ladies what I think of you. I
hoped I should never have a boy in my school who
would not control himself for a moment to give his
attention to sacred things. What was it, pray, that
{10}you had to say, of such importance that it could not
wait for a second?”

Johnson, who had been observing that it was wise
to ask for thankful hearts for such mercies, was
silent.

“Now,” said Mr. Merry, preparing again to bend
his head, “we will say grace again, and I hope
nothing so humiliating will occur a second time.
I shall not speak of the matter, Johnson.”

Mrs. Merry and Miss Basden bowed their heads
a little lower than before, though it was hardly to
be thought that their experience had not been suitable.

“I cannot bear to see a sulky boy,” said
Mr. Merry, throwing a disgusted glance at Johnson.

“Will you have tea or coffee, dear?” said
Mrs. Merry.

“Oh, either, either; anything will do for me.”

“I always arrange for you to have your choice,
dear.”

“Yes, Mother; yes. You take good care of me.
You spend your life taking care of people, I am
afraid.” Mr. Merry looked round on the boys with
an air of rebuking ingratitude.

“Yes, I have done a good deal of taking care
in my time. I think I have done very little else.”

“Well, Mrs. Merry, we must begin to take care
of you,” said Miss Basden, putting the toast rack
near to Mrs. Merry.

“How did you sleep, Miss Basden?” said
Mr. Merry, in an extremely interested manner.

“Mrs. Merry,” Miss Basden said, in a rather
high monotone, “the boys are saying that the
{11}marmalade is watery. I am telling them that
no water is used in marmalade, that marmalade
does not contain water; so I do not see how it
can be.”

“I do not see how it can be, either; but of course
I wish to be told if anything is not as nice as it
can be. Let me taste the marmalade.”

Miss Basden offered a spoon from the pot.

“It seems to me that it is very nice. Perhaps
I am not a judge of marmalade. I do not care to
eat it on bread with butter myself. One or the other
is enough for me. But it seems to me to be very
nice.”

“Mother, don’t water the boys’ preserves,” said
Mr. Merry, nodding his head up and down.
“Don’t try to make things go further than they
will go, you know. The game isn’t worth the
candle.”

“I do not understand you, dear. There is never
any extra water in preserves. They would not keep
if they had water in them. There would not be any
object in it. It would be less economical, not more.”

“Oh, well, Mother, I don’t know anything about
the kitchen business and that. But if the marmalade
is not right, let us have it right another time. That
is all I mean.”

“I do not think you know what you mean, dear.”

“No, Mother, no; very likely I don’t.”

“The housekeeping is not your province, Mr.
Merry,” said Miss Basden. “You will have us
coming and telling you how to teach Latin, if you are
not careful.”

{12}“Ah, Miss Basden, ah, you saucy lady! Not
such a babel down at that part of the room! Not
such a babel. Do you hear me? Be quiet, or
go away, and leave the room to civilized people.”
Mr. Merry looked fiercely towards the other end of
the table, which certainly tended to be the noisier.

“Mr. Burgess is not going to allow us much of his
company at breakfast this morning,” said Miss
Basden.

“I wonder if Fanny called him,” said Mrs. Merry.

“Yes, she called him,” said Miss Basden.

“Ah! he’s fond of the sheets, is Mr. Burgess.
He is fond of the sheets,” said Mr. Merry; while the
boys found this talk of the under-master a cause for
nudges and smiles.

“I never can understand how people can lie in bed
in daylight,” said Miss Basden.

“Now it would do you good to do a little more of
it, Miss Basden,” said Mr. Merry. “You do too
much of the other thing, as I always tell you. It
would do you good to do a little more of it.”

“Oh, that sort of advice does not have much effect
on me, Mr. Merry,” said Miss Basden, again cutting
bread.

“You give poor Miss Basden a great deal of work
to do,” said Mr. Merry, looking down the rows of
boys with vague disapproval.

“You must make haste, all of you. Mr. Herrick
will be here to read prayers in a minute,” said
Mrs. Merry.

“Mother, ought not Mr. Burgess’ bacon to be
kept hot?” said Mr. Merry, his voice conveying
{13}criticism of Mr. Burgess, and the need of diplomacy
with him.

“We do not usually expect people to come down
when breakfast is over,” said Mrs. Merry. “The
bacon was hot when it was brought in.”

“Fanny,” said Mr. Merry, in a tone of apology
to the maid who was waiting, “just put Mr.
Burgess’ bacon down in the fender, will you?
Thank you, Fanny, very much.”

“I do not like more bread cut than will be eaten,”
said Mrs. Merry.

“Mrs. Merry, several boys asked for some more
only a minute ago,” said Miss Basden.

“If you asked for it, eat it,” said Mr. Merry. “If
you asked for it, eat it. Do not give the trouble of
cutting it, and then cause more disturbance by
refusing it. If you have eaten all the rest, you can
easily manage a little more.”

As the chairs were pushed from the table, Mr.
Herrick entered. He was the actual owner of the
school, Mr. Merry being his partner. He was a
short, impressive old man with a solid neck and head,
heavy grey hair, and features with a touch of the
Jew. He was a writer, and kept his time for his
own, and read prayers to the school by way of acting
as its head. He had placed his school in the old
university town, to be near the college where he had
spent his youth. Mr. Merry stood out in the room,
half bowing towards him.

“Good morning, Mr. Herrick, good morning. It
is a frosty day. That is why we are a little late.
Frost makes good appetites; that is one good thing
{14}that it does. We were just going to get up from
the table, when there was a demand for more bread
and butter. By no means the first demand, eh,
boys?”

The boys signified amongst themselves their sense
of the doubleness of Mr. Merry’s nature. Mr.
Herrick half bowed in his turn to Mr. Merry, quite
bowed to Mrs. Merry, and again to Miss Basden;
nodded to the boys, and sat down and opened the
Bible. As he did so, there appeared Mr. Burgess,
who walked into the room with an air of being
unconscious that he would not find things at a
natural stage for a new-comer.

“Ah, Mr. Burgess,” said Mr. Merry, as Mr.
Burgess’ eyes began to take in that matters had gone
so far; “we have been talking about you. The only
thing we could do, as we could not talk to you.
There is a place that is very comfortable on a frosty
morning. Eh?”

Mr. Merry’s way of addressing his head and
his junior for the ears of the boys, had grown to a
habit.

“Am I late?” said Mr. Burgess, in a casual,
courteous tone.

“Good morning, Burgess,” said Herrick, his eyes
on his book.

Mr. Merry sat down.

Mr. Burgess, as just perceiving that prayers were
about to be held, took his seat.

“Pray do not allow us to keep you waiting for
breakfast, Burgess,” said Herrick. “Take your
seat at the table, I beg of you.”

{15}“Oh no, Mr. Herrick. I shall like to...take
my part with you as usual, thank you. It matters
very little to me what time I breakfast. Often I am
out of doors for an hour or two before. I have very
little sense of time in the morning.”

There was a titter from the boys.

“Yes, Mr. Herrick,” said Mr. Merry, with an air
of apology, and a fierce sidelong glance; “he goes
out sometimes before breakfast to get his exercise, you
know. Young fellows always will be thinking of
keeping fit, you know.”

“Mr. Burgess will have to take out the boys this
morning, Mr. Merry,” said Miss Basden, leaning
forward.

Mr. Burgess sat with an air exclusively expectant
of Herrick’s reading. He greatly disliked Miss
Basden, though there was a belief among the boys
that he designed to wed her. Herrick began to read,
and Miss Basden listened with colour deepened, and
Mr. Burgess with an appearance of attentive interest.
When the assembly rose from its knees, Herrick at
once bore the Bible from the room. Mr. Burgess
stepped to the window, and sought the signs of the
sky.

“Come, now, Mr. Burgess,” said Mr. Merry,
making amends to his junior by lifting his bacon
himself from the fender. “If you are not hungry
by this time, you should be. Pray do not hurry.
The boys will not hurt by a little waiting.”

“Oh, thank you, Mr. Merry,” said Mr Burgess,
coming to the table, and taking up the sugar tongs.
“I had no idea of the time. But boys do not hurt
{16}by a little waiting; that is true. Adams, just see if
my paper is in the hall.”

Adams obeyed with a feeling of respect for
Mr. Burgess, which Mr. Merry was almost disposed
to share. Mr. Burgess received his paper, and put
down his fork to turn to its pages. Mr. Merry
inquired if the boys were waiting for their footman
to bring them their boots.

Mr. Burgess, left to himself, set to his breakfast
with an energy he had not shown that day, except
at his toilet. Even if boys did hurt by waiting, these
would not have suffered. He put his paper in his
pocket, and at a distance from the house began to
read. Returning, he saw Mr. Merry at a window.
He looked back at the paper, and in a moment turned
to a boy and said: “So you see, Parliament thought
that Bill a wrong one, and it was thrown out.”

“Well, what news, Mr. Burgess?” said Mr.
Merry, coming into the hall.

“Oh, nothing to speak of. Just a few little things
to glance at,” said Mr. Burgess, defining the scope
of his attention. “Would you care to have the
paper, Mr. Merry?”

“Thank you, Mr. Burgess, thank you. I am a
poor man. I don’t rise to the *Times*.”

Mr. Burgess went without a word to the class-room
where the elder pupils were taught. Mr. Merry
shuffled into the other, and sat down before the
younger boys. He had not been prompted to the
teacher’s life by his liberal education. There were
other and more urgent reasons for his choice.

Mrs. Merry taught the scripture of the school, and
{17}there was a general sense of her fitness for the task,
based upon her temperament rather than her
scholarship. Mr. Merry often mentioned the fact of her
teaching it to parents.

The boys, who had a tendency to giggle this
morning, took their seats about her table.

“It is the scripture lesson,” she said, with
peaceful lips. “I think we are forgetting that.”

The boys read aloud a chapter verse by verse, and
Mrs. Merry added observations, in a gentle, rather
peculiar voice used only on these occasions. At
questions she turned to the commentary, and read it
out; and it was felt that difficulties had been met as
far as reverence permitted. An especial discrepancy
caused an increase of mirth. Mrs. Merry looked
straight at the questioner.

“I don’t think we will cavil about it, Johnson.
We will just think of it. That will be the best, and
the most difficult thing. The book says nothing,
you see.”

It was felt that a cheap effort had been made; but
the laughter held its own.

Mrs. Merry looked very long at a boy.

“It is only the Bible, Bentley; only the most
sacred book in existence that you are
laughing at.”

“It is only the Bible, Bentley.”

“I shall have to give you up, boys.”

Mrs. Merry, with a look round that said many
things, rose and walked from the room.

“Constant laughing and inattention make it
impossible to teach them!”

{18}Mr. Merry entered, hunching his shoulders and
driving his hands violently into his pockets.

“Well, now, I am degraded. *I* am degraded. I
feel it a personal humiliation to have to come and
speak to people supposed to be gentlemen, about
their making it impossible for a lady to teach them.
For a lady to teach them scripture! For a lady to
teach them holy things! There is an unspeakable
thing to find happening in my school. I shall not
speak of it. I cannot bring myself to do so. And
I hope that no boy in this room will speak to me
again to-day. Because I could not come down to his
level, and there is the truth for him.”

It was Mrs. Merry’s birthday, and she knew that
a present from the boys would be placed on the table
at tea. It had been subscribed for by them in private
consultation with Miss Basden, and chosen by that
lady and Mrs. Merry in the town together.

By tea time Mrs. Merry had reached the state,
which justified her yearly message, that she was
prevented by a headache from appearing. The boys
begged Miss Basden to approach her. Mr. Merry
sat vaguely ill at ease, kept as it were in bands by
the parcel at the head of the table.

Mrs. Merry sent word that she would try and come
for a moment; and entered, flushed and unexpectant,
and approached her place.

“Why, what is this? What can this be? Why,
I do not understand this, boys.”

Miss Basden stepped forward and quickly cut the
string, in the manner of one tying gunpowder to a
friend at the stake.

{19}“Oh, boys,” said Mrs. Merry. “Oh, boys!
Oh, what is this? Oh, you should not spend your
money on me. I had no expectation of anything
like this. And the very thing that I needed! Some
good fairy must have...”

Her voice failed.

“There, Mother, there, you’re not well,” said
Mr. Merry. “You’re not well, as you told us,
Mother. And so you get upset. We know how it
is. It is just because you look after us all too well.
We know how pleased you are. So you need not
trouble to tell us any more. Come, have your tea,
boys. Have your tea, and it is very kind of you
all. What is that commotion in the hall above?
Williams, just see what the commotion in the hall is.
Thank you, Williams, very much.”

It was reported that a lady was in the hall, and
that Mr. Herrick requested that Mr. Merry would
join him.

“What a time to come to see a school! After
keeping myself free from seven in the morning, I am
not allowed to have a cup of tea in peace. People
will be coming in the middle of the night next.
If there’s a thing I can’t bear, it’s want of
consideration.”

Mr. Merry hastened up the stairs, and at the top
caused his face to undergo a change, preparatory to
whatever final one might be expedient.

“Oh, this is Mr. Merry! What a shame to call
him away from his boys! But I can only stay a
moment, so I shall not keep him.”

“Now, what a thing to be saying of me!” said
{20}Mr. Merry, taking the stranger’s hand in both of his,
with fond eyes. “What a thing to be saying of me!
That I should think it a shame to be called away to
you. Not but what I am fond of my boys. Yes, I
am fond of my boys.”

“I saw such a dear little boy in the hall.”

“Ah, the little rascal! Little mischief that he is,
always running about, when he ought to be at his
books! Ah, well, they like a run from time to time.
And he is not over strong, the little fellow. When
he came to us, it went to my heart to see him. But
my wife, she coddles him, you know. She coddles
him, and he is a different boy.”

“Oh, how nice for an anxious mother to hear!
Because we can’t expect Mr. Herrick to give his mind
to all the little things a mother thinks of.”

“Oh, we won’t tell Mr. Herrick what we think of
him,” said Mr. Merry, as his chief followed his
custom of leaving him unhampered play for his gifts.
“Perhaps he knows without our telling him.
Sometimes I see him reading all about himself in the
papers.”

“And about the general teaching of the school?
Mr. Herrick does not do a great deal of the ordinary
work, does he?” Mr. Merry reflected that Herrick
had gone far in the minutes before his release.
“But of course you have masters to help you?”

“Now, I tell you a thing,” said Mr. Merry, lifting
his questioner’s hand up and down, a picture of Mr.
Burgess before his eyes. “You have confidence in
us. In me and my wife, and my good helpers; and
above all, in your boy. And there is one of us you
{21}won’t be disappointed in. I can promise you that.
And that is the last. And the first too, isn’t he?
Bless him, yes. And now there is a thing I want
to say. I am here to make the boys happy. Little
fellows away from home need to be made happy, you
know. A master who is known all over the world
is an enormous thing for a boy. I wish I had had
as much in my young days. But that is not quite
all that is wanted. A mother knows that.”

On his way back through the hall Mr. Merry
passed Mr. Herrick without a word. The quality of
Mr. Merry’s that gained him his bread was never
alluded to between them.

“Well, there is another one come and gone,
Mother. Another ship in the night. One never
knows if anything will come of it. And a third of
what comes out of one more boy won’t overflow our
coffers, will it?”

There was a titter from the boys.

“You get on with your tea,” said Mr. Merry.
“And don’t be so humiliatingly deceived as to think
that another one of you would be of any advantage
to anyone. Because such an idea would be
humiliating to you. I can tell you that.”

“I do not think I could do with another boy,” said
Mrs. Merry, in a gentle, distinct tone.

“No, I should not like you to have anything more
on you, Mrs. Merry,” said Miss Basden.

“I don’t know that I could either,” said Mr
Burgess.

“Oh well, Mr. Burgess, it wouldn’t be too much
on you,” said Mr. Merry. “We should see to that.
{22}It would be all fitting in together for you, you
know.”

Mr. Burgess looked towards the window.

“I could always do with what had to be done
with,” said Miss Basden. “But the boys are quite
mistaken, if they think that is any indication that
they are needed by anyone. It is they who do the
needing, I think.”

“Yes, Miss Basden,” said Mr. Merry, nodding
his head. “It is indeed. They who do the
needing! I should think so. I should be glad to
be told of something they don’t need. Because I
don’t know of anything, and that is the truth. I
have just been hearing what is good enough for
them. And I don’t see anything about them that
seems to call for it. I don’t, indeed.”

{23}## Chapter II

“This is a good room to come back to,” said
Herrick. “That hall and the woman, and poor
Merry shuffling up to do his duty! It made me
shiver.”

“The sight of duty does make one shiver,” said
Miss Herrick. “The actual doing of it would kill
one, I think.”

Emily Herrick was a tall, dark woman of fifty,
half-sister to Herrick, with a face that somehow
recalled an attractive idol’s, iron-grey hair wound in
plaits about her head, and a quick, deep voice.

“Merry knows what the duty is,” said Herrick.
“For my life, I don’t.”

“One couldn’t know what that duty was,” said
Miss Herrick. “It could only be felt, and perhaps
you have too good a brain to do things in that way.”

“Let us leave it at that,” said Herrick.

“To think that you made the school!” said
Emily. “For it was you who made it. But of
course you would do the creative part.”

“Yes, yes. And I could go on with it,” said
Herrick.

“Of course you could,” said Emily. “Wouldn’t
it be dreadful if you had to? Or if you did? It is
almost dreadful that you could.”

“Yes, yes, it is,” said Herrick. “I am an
ordinary man.”

{24}“I didn’t mean that, darling,” said Emily.
“They say that teachers are born, not made. I know
that schoolmasters are. And it was for a schoolmaster
that we wanted Mr. Merry.”

“It is for a schoolmaster we have him, anyhow,”
said Herrick, sitting down at his desk.

“We must get out of the way of talking as if we
were not honest, Nicholas,” said Emily. “Anyone
dishonest beside Mr. Merry would be such a waste,
and wastefulness in a school is so unwise. And
Mr. Merry has such charm in all that he does.”

“Merry is as open as the day,” said Herrick.

“Of course,” said Emily. “That is what I
meant. What charm could there be in dishonesty
apart from that? Ought you to write any more
to-day, dear? You have written more than usual,
after being up all night.”

“I must go on separating my papers from old
Crabbe’s,” said Herrick. “I found some things of
his to go through, and I took some of my own to
deal with. I knew it would be a long night. And
he did not want much looking to, poor old Crabbe!
Eighty-nine if he was a day, and a long sinking, as
if he were not done out enough to die! He did not
suffer, or hardly, and Masson and Bumpus and I
watched by him at the end. Well, may we all do
as well, die at ninety, easily, and with our friends
round us. I had rather have friends than children.
Men with the same outlook, not people looking for
their main spell after we are gone! Well, Emily,
I hope you will watch by me one day, as I watched
by my old friend last night.”

{25}“How beautifully you speak, darling!” said
Emily, putting up her glass to look at her brother.
“And what a lot of good you have done! But I
don’t think you have made very kind plans for me.
But perhaps you have left my deathbed to Mr.
Merry. There is no reason why he shouldn’t take
all your responsibilities. And to carry out your
scheme for yourself for an outsider, is very rare of
you. It could hardly be expected for one of your
own family.”

“Ah, Emily,” said Herrick. “You are twenty
years younger than me. That is a thing we don’t
reckon with, but it is there. You don’t look back or
forward yet. We can’t look forward really; but I
think I can look back, and see my life as not
lacking.”

Herrick lived in his disappointment that in letters
he had done only critical work.

“I never look back on my life,” said Emily.
“It seems to be lacking in too much. You are so
brave. There are William and Richard coming in.
Guests must not be torn between admiration and
anxiety, like people in the house.”

William Masson was a tall, large man in late
middle age, with loose limbs and loose clothes, and
a weather-beaten, high-boned face. He seemed an
example of all the uneasinesses combined into ease.

His companion was a little, dark man about
fifty-six, with eyes sunk deeply in a working face.

The two were Fellows and dons at Herrick’s
college, and had meant romance for each other in
youth. They had watched with Herrick at the
{26}deathbed of an old don, who had outlived his
friends.

“Well, well,” said Herrick, “so he is gone, the
old man! We shall all be in his place one day. I
am fortunate in having you all younger than me. I
have not to think of dying, surrounded by no one
who is of my own kind and age. I can’t help being
glad that it is I who will have to look to you at
the end, and not you to me.”

“He has been explaining to me,” said Emily,
“how I must die, unattended, while he has
everybody kept alive for him. Nicholas has a wonderful
gift for getting the best out of others. Think of
Mr. Merry.”

“I never cease to revere you for that, Herrick,”
said Bumpus.

“I don’t really revere Nicholas so much as Mr.
Merry,” said Emily. “At least, I don’t know. It
was wonderful of Nicholas. I thought it mattered
about Mr. Merry’s not being educated, as we were
having him for a schoolmaster.”

“Yes, yes,” said Masson, in his high,
stammering voice. “I confess I rather thought that.”

“I did not think that,” said Bumpus. “But I
didn’t know what did mattter. The thing Merry
has, isn’t a thing one could guess.”

“Well, I always trust myself to judge a person at
sight,” said Herrick. “It is borne in upon me how
a person is this or that. And I never find myself
wrong. It is a gift that we are either with or
without.”

“I believe gifts are like that,” said Bumpus.

{27}“That is unkind, Dickie,” said Emily.

“You may have to see us all out, Herrick,” said
Bumpus. “You are past the danger age.”

“It is true that people who live to be seventy
often do live to a great age,” said Herrick. “They
are in a sense out of danger.”

“I believe you seem to be planning my death,”
said Emily, “and without any arrangements at all for
my deathbed. I hope you really do trust Mr. Merry.
Not only with the kind of trust that does for boys.”

“I am sixty,” said Masson. “I claim also to
be out of danger.”

“How exacting you all are about your amount of
life!” said Bumpus. “But of course we are all of
us too good to die.”

“Well, well, we shall go on, doing things it has
been in us to do here, that we have not done,” said
Herrick. “Ah, you do not think so, Emily. But
this modern thought has you in its grip. You will
grow out of it.”

“That will be nice and flexible of me, to grow out
of things at fifty. They say that unusual people do
develope very late.”

“I can’t understand how people fear death,” said
Herrick. “It seems to me the most usual, natural
thing, the last thing to be feared.”

“It is very usual. It might even be called
universal,” said Bumpus.

“Don’t be shallow and witty, Dickie,” said
Emily. “Nicholas was speaking of deeper truth.”

“I don’t find anything shocking in seeing death
ahead for me,” said Masson.

{28}“No, you see it as it is, and yourself as you are,”
said Bumpus. “You are a long way above and
below the rest of us. Below is the wrong word.”

“I should have thought he was above
everything,” said Emily. “I never like to think of it for
him. It must be so hard to be like that. We are
very brave to be able to talk about death. As brave
as people who feel able to make their wills.”

“I always wondered why Crabbe never wrote,”
said Herrick. “He should have, shouldn’t he?
Shouldn’t he now have written?”

“He never did. Not a line,” said Bumpus.

“I suppose a search after anything would be no
good? I came across two or three scraps of different
things. They are over there with my papers. But
nothing of use.”

“No, no, no,” said Masson, firmly for him. “A
search for anything would be no good. He had
nothing. He kept nothing. He was as light as air.
He had no friends but ourselves. No
contemporaries outliving him. There seems to be no one
to be notified of his death.”

“That is how Nicholas wants me to be,” said
Emily.

“Ah!” said Herrick.

“He has died as he lived,” went on Masson.
“Keeping nothing, needing nothing, asking nothing.
A search of his rooms would be like searching a
field.”

“You ought to write, William,” said Emily.
“You really have written, after saying things like
that.”

{29}“I have been thinking of writing again,” said
Bumpus, putting his hand over his eyes. “But I
expect you all forget that I ever wrote. I don’t know
if you do remember how dramatic I was once as a
youth, when—natural and reasonable it seemed to
me then—I caused a manuscript to be put into the
grave of a friend? I have written nothing since.
I didn’t mean that his death prevented me from
writing later. That sort of thing comes out, if it is
there. Though it is astonishing how many of us
are capable of a single thing. But I have been
writing a little book lately. I don’t know why I
should say little, except that it is short.”

“This is good to hear, Richard,” said Masson.

“Too good,” said Emily. “I am so jealous for
Nicholas. And he hasn’t a story in his life, either.
I mean, not a beautiful story.”

“I seem as if I must still write like a boy,” said
Bumpus, more freely and eagerly. “I find myself
having to prune and tighten and mature. I don’t
know if it is breaking off in youth that makes me go
on as if from where I left off. I don’t believe we are
ever much farther than at twenty-five.”

“I don’t think I am,” said Herrick. “For I
also am thinking of bringing out a little book soon.
Yes, Emily, you may look at me through that glass.
I put off telling you until I should have the
countenance of friends. For pleading guilty to turning
real author at seventy! So we coincide, Bumpus.
But I wish our ages coincided.”

“This is surely coincidence enough,” said
Bumpus.

{30}“I don’t wish anything more,” said Emily.
“And how wonderful we are to have you coincide!
It is selfless and beautiful of William and me.”

“That is what I feel,” said Bumpus.

“And I also am pleased with my little book,”
went on Herrick, taking his sister’s hand, “and
also don’t know why I call it little, except that it is
short. Short it is, and that’s the truth; though I
don’t know why we should prefer a long book. If
a book is a whole in itself, why is its length any
matter?”

“But you do prefer a long one, darling,” said
Emily. “I always like that side of you. And now
I know it is the simplicity of greatness. But don’t
make the book any longer. It is so careless of
popular opinion to leave it short.”

“I wish...I wonder why we give voice to
these wishes; but I wish old Crabbe had lived to see
you with a book written, Herrick,” said Masson.
“He always said that you were a man who would
write, if you put yourself to it.”

“Just what Nicholas has been saying of him,”
said Emily. “How beautiful they both are!”

“I have been a long fool, idle through seventy
years of a good life,” said Herrick. “But I don’t
know that I can wish that about Crabbe. I feel as if
I should not have written this book, apart from his
death; as if it would not have shaped itself in my
mind as I now feel it. Of course there is no
connection. None at all. None. But it came to me,
as I sat there, the whole thing, the whole book.
There it was. I can’t explain it.”

{31}“It doesn’t seem good management,” said Emily.
“To keep your book to yourself for seventy years,
and then have Mr. Crabbe die to make it come out.
But you are not a good manager; and Mr. Merry
can’t do more than most of our life for both of us,
and my death. And Mr. Crabbe was ninety, and
you had it all so nice for him.”

“How long will it take you actually to write it,
Herrick?” said Bumpus.

“I have it this time,” said Herrick. “I have
been letting it grow in my head. Because of
course in a way it has been there for some time.
It is as good as written down. It was the form of it
that flashed on me. I do things much in my head,
as you know.”

“Oh, Nicholas, I didn’t know. I do admire
you,” said Emily.

“I think I have found myself at last,” said
Herrick. “I think that, God willing, I shall have
done my little bit for my generation, done what every
man ought to do, before he dies.”

“You don’t really think it is what every man
ought to do,” said Emily. “I do hope it isn’t.”

“Assuming God, you wouldn’t do much if he
wasn’t willing,” said Masson.

Bumpus laughed, and looked almost proudly at
Masson.

“Are we going to be broad and wicked?” said
Emily. “I like that, because I am not very
educated, and so still young in my mind. Really,
it would be nice to have some religion, and not go
on without ever any comfort. And I am not like
{32}Nicholas, who is really God’s equal, and not his child
at all. I think it is better not to have God than to
be like that with him.”

“It is rather empty for him not to be had,” said
Bumpus. “He always seems to me a pathetic
figure, friendless and childless and set up alone in a
miserable way.”

“Yes, he has a touch of William in him,” said
Emily. “But you know he isn’t childless. We
give even our boys more advantages than that.
Mrs. Merry gives it to them.”

“You can have him childless in these days,” said
Bumpus. “But if you have him, I like him really.
I like him not childless, and grasping and fond of
praise. I like the human and family interest.”

“Yes, he tends to be neutral nowadays,” said
Masson. “Perhaps I do resemble him in that.”

“And he had such a personality,” said Emily.
“Such a superior, vindictive and over-indulgent one.
He is one of the best drawn characters in fiction.”

“I really cannot listen to this,” said Herrick.

“Isn’t it quietly conscientious of Herrick, to be
behind the parents’ backs what he is to their faces?”
said Bumpus. “What he would be to their faces if
he saw them.”

“I am deeply grateful to Merry,” said Herrick.
“Nobody knows what seeing them is.”

“Mr. Merry does,” said Emily. “I am not
grateful to him. I am cringing under a load of
obligation. And he is a tragic figure, and haunts me.
Now to Mrs. Merry I am just healthily grateful.
And to Miss Basden my gratitude is quite of a brisk,
{33}employing kind. I almost feel more kindly to Mr.
Burgess, who has to have the opposite of gratitude,
though I never quite know why. Now I must go
and ask Mrs. Merry if we may ask you to stay to
dinner. I always think Nicholas and I carry that off
so well, having to ask permission to have guests.”

“How Emily runs on and on, doesn’t she?” said
Herrick. “Day after day, year after year, the
stream never runs dry.”

“It doesn’t seem that it could,” said Masson;
“that Emily could ever be subject to age.”

“I always wonder if she had any youth,” said
Bumpus, his eyes sweeping over Masson. “She
seems somehow ageless, to have nothing to do with
age.”

“You knew her when she was young,” said
Herrick. “But you were young too, then. She
was wonderfully like what she is now. No, I think
in a sense she had no youth, just as in a way she will
have no old age. She is of that type. A rare
one.”

“I think the two omissions compensate for each
other,” said Masson.

“I do not. I like the whole of experience,” said
Bumpus.

“I always wonder,” went on Herrick, in the tone
of a man who kept back nothing of his heart, “if I
should have been happier or unhappier without her.
I am never bound by convention; and the question
arises in the case of any intimate relationship,
however good. We could all have moulded ourselves
differently.”

{34}“We can’t change the stuff in the mould,” said
Masson.

“And Emily is a woman with a good deal of the
man in her,” said Bumpus.

“Oh, I have had more to do with women than you
two have,” said Herrick. “I am not as much off
the common line. But most of my life’s
relationships have been with men. But that is what I meant.
I wonder what I should have been, if I had not had
Emily. And, William, you are thinking, what would
she have been. But I am never the slave of
convention.”

“Don’t stop,” said Emily, returning. “I like
talk that is unfit for me. It is having to get
used to Nicholas, who is not the slave of
convention, as he says. Fancy being able to say that
truthfully!”

“I believe in the interest of oneself, you know,”
said Herrick, going on as if he had not heard his
sister. “I take the deepest interest in myself, apart
from egotism of personality, though I may have that.
And I have no condemnation for egotists. I think
they are often the higher type.”

“This is not the kind of unfitness I meant,” said
Emily. “It does sound wicked, but not with a
wickedness that I like.”

“I think on the whole they are not,” said Masson.

“You could not be an egotist, William, whether
or no you wanted it,” said Bumpus.

“Surely everybody would want it,” said Emily.
“I am sure it would be dreadful not to be one.
Isn’t it, William?”

{35}“Egotism is a gift, like anything else,” said
Herrick.

“Then I grow prouder and prouder of you,
darling,” said Emily. “An author and an egotist,
and both of them such lovely things.”

“I suppose your book is a novel, Herrick? Mine
is,” said Bumpus.

“Yes, yes. A short novel,” said Herrick. “I
hold no brief for long books, as I say.”

“Real books coming out of our own heads!” said
Bumpus. “And not just printed unkindness to
other people’s.”

“My first original piece of writing!” said
Herrick. “That I should have to say it at seventy!
Not just what Richard has said. Ah, I have felt
that. Not that I have not done good work in that
way. And it all has to be done. But my first book.
Probably my only book, though many would be
surprised to hear me say so. I thrill like a youth at the
thought of seeing it out.”

“Oh, so do I,” said Emily. “But not like a
youth. Though I should love to do that once again.
And it is better and safer at seventy. It will have
to have the respect due to age, anyhow. But I am
afraid Mr. Merry will think it is a story book.
Perhaps we had better keep it from him.”

“He must know about it when it comes out,” said
Masson.

“No, I don’t think Mr. Merry knows about books
when they come out,” said Emily.

Masson and Bumpus returned to the college,
entered Masson’s rooms, and sat for a time in silence.

{36}“Well, William,” said Bumpus, “I have
protested that I have written a book. You must know
that it is your part to seem to want to talk about it.”

“If you would like to talk of it with me,” said
Masson. “I think that men who take only to
science, cannot be on the point enough in these
things to be bearable.”

“I suppose you will not read it,” said Bumpus.
“Or if you do, will not tell me what you think of it.”

“Am—am I of the sort to read it?” said Masson.
“I hesitate, as I say, to inflict the alien touch.”

“It is this that thirty years has brought us to,”
said Bumpus.

“I—I think it is a good thing to come to, to keep
to,” said Masson, his voice going high. “I think
it is the worst thing about intimacy, that it may blunt
every edge.”

“Yes, yes. Edges are the only thing,” said
Bumpus. “It is odd about Herrick, isn’t it? His
writing a book.”

“Odd, is it?” said Masson. “Oughtn’t he to
have written before?”

“That does seem to me the alien touch,” said
Bumpus.

“Well, perhaps it will hardly be a good book,
said Masson.

Bumpus laughed.

“I should have said that Herrick knew too well
for that. He has his hand on his name with great
skill. ‘Oughtn’t he to have written?’ That is
what he has done. I don’t follow. It is certainly
odd how both he and I seem to have come to it
{37}suddenly. It is dwelling on the time when I sacrificed
my other book, that has brought me to it. My mind
has been on it lately. I don’t know why I should
be sensitive about it. My feelings had nothing in
them to be ashamed of. This book seems to start
out of all that, somehow, to go on from it. Well,
there is nothing between.”

“In that way,” said Masson. “You—you feel
deeply about the book, Richard?”

“Yes,” said Bumpus, leaning forward, looking
small and tense and alive. “I have wanted to write
all my life, felt it was this, it was mine to want. And
it seemed not to come to me, after the early time
when things happened as we know. There seems to
be one book in a good many of us. And, of course,
that one book of mine was mine no longer.”

“No, no,” said Masson, not raising his eyes.

“So this means much to me,” said Bumpus,
looking at Masson.

“It—it means then much to me,” said Masson.
“Perhaps Herrick’s book is the one book in him that
is in many of us.”

“No,” said Bumpus, laughing. “I have more
than one in me, and Herrick has not one at all.”

“Then the book must explain itself,” said Masson.

“I believe I am capable of any meanness,” said
Bumpus suddenly, “short of actually cheating
people of their own.”

“Is there much meanness short of some form of
that,” said Masson.

“No, no, none that matters,” said Bumpus.

{38}## Chapter III

The Reverend Peter Fletcher was a frail little elderly
man, with a long, black beard, and a colourless face
that carried a humorous kindliness. His wife,
Theresa, was a large old woman, with fierce eyes
looking out between a massive brow and chin. His
sister, Miss Lydia Fletcher, was a clumsy-looking
woman of sixty, with a broad, flat, benevolent face;
and the Reverend Francis Fletcher, a nephew, was
an over-sized, youngish man, with solemn eyes.

“Say grace, Peter,” said Theresa, looking up
from carving.

“I have just done so, my dear,” said Mr.
Fletcher.

“Peter, you see the result of thirty years of your
example,” said Bumpus, who was a cousin of Mr.
Fletcher’s, and gave an impression of a faint Fletcher
likeness embodied in a great difference.

“I think it is a beautiful result,” said Emily, who
was a friend of Theresa’s. “Fancy just not noticing
grace after thirty years!”

“Being so free from nervous hurry at the least,”
said Bumpus.

“Oh, one does not offer oneself as an example to
one’s elders and betters,” said Mr. Fletcher, giving
{39}his peculiar smile, in which he stretched his lips
without parting them, so that his teeth were not displayed.

He was nine months younger than his wife.

“Ah, it is so difficult to have the control of
oneself,” said Miss Lydia, in a mysterious undertone,
with her hand over her mouth. “It seems that
nothing is so small that we can do it without asking
help.”

“Theresa does everything without help, doesn’t
she?” said Bumpus.

“Of course nobody who does that, could do quite
actually everything,” said Emily.

“No. Not without help, no. Without always
asking help, perhaps,” murmured Miss Lydia.
“For we can’t do things without help. No.”

“Is the farewell sermon ready, Peter?” said
Theresa.

“A farewell sermon! I do hope you had help,”
said Bumpus.

“A life of work, and extra work to round it off!”
said Theresa.

“Lyddie, is it ready?” said Mr. Fletcher.

“The sermon is not my province,” said Miss
Lydia, firmly on the truth.

“But couldn’t it be with help?” said Emily.
“Oughtn’t you to get particular help, being inside
things as you are? Or is everything just coldly
fair?”

Miss Lydia looked at the table.

“Aunt Lyddie is to do the work to the end, isn’t
she, Uncle Peter?” said Francis.

“Yes, yes, surely,” said Mr. Fletcher.

{40}“It is not a woman’s business to preach,” said
Miss Lydia.

“Of course not,” said Emily. “I did not think
of that. I didn’t mean I thought it was.”

“Is it done, dear?” said Theresa.

“I have mapped it out in outline,” said Mr.
Fletcher, leaning back with his finger tips together.
“I have still two or three matters to look up.”

“You are self-important, Peter,” said Bumpus.

“Well, with a farewell sermon, that is just being
open and above deceit,” said Emily.

“I shouldn’t trouble about it,” said Theresa.
“The people who will hear it have never troubled
about you.”

“I should denounce them at the last,” said
Bumpus. “No, I should not. I should be very
subtle and aloof.”

“I do envy you for retiring,” said Emily.
“Fancy, if Nicholas could give up the school!”

“Ah, he is needed,” said Mr. Fletcher.

“Oh, he is not, Peter,” said Emily. “You
should not have little ways of making yourself
popular.”

“There is a great deal of ritualism in the town,”
said Miss Lydia, rolling the “r.” “A great deal.
It is so much we have to fight against. But we
must be so thankful that we are allowed to do
something.”

“The other side seems to be allowed to do more,”
said Theresa. “I hope they are more thankful.”

“Lyddie,” said Bumpus, “have you been told
about Theresa’s being made on purpose without
{41}charity, because of the double share of Peter, with
whom she was to become one?”

“Ah, but these ritualists do harm. They do harm.
They are not right. It is idolatrous,” said Miss
Lydia, looking in front of her.

“The true reasons for the simpler service
have possibly never even reached them,” said
Mr. Fletcher.

“No, no, Peter; keep a hand on yourself,” said
Bumpus. “That does not extend to us. We are
more of a credit to you than that.”

“It is certainly time that Peter retired,” said
Theresa.

“Where do your boys attend church?” said Miss
Lydia to Emily, in a mysterious, piercing whisper.

“My boys?” said Emily. “How nice of you!
Because that is the impression we want to make. At
the chapel of the college where Nicholas used to be.
Richard’s college.”

“Merry arranged it as a reminder to people that
Herrick was a Fellow there,” said Bumpus.

“You are very nice people to be employed by,”
said Miss Lydia, her voice suggesting unworthiness
in Mr. Merry.

“Yes, we try to be grateful,” said Emily. “It
is so generous to be employed. Nicholas and I really
have to shirk our part of it.”

“Mrs. Merry is a good religious woman?” said
Miss Lydia, raising her eyes but not her head.

“Yes. That is what she is. You are wonderful
at descriptions.”

“I am sure, Aunt Lyddie, that Miss Herrick’s and
{42}Mr. Herrick’s influence is everywhere in the school,”
said Francis. “I have so often heard about it in
the town.”

“I wonder if that is all right,” said Bumpus.
“Are we quite sure what Merry wants about that?”

“Mr. Merry is very happy in having no place in
his life for criticism at all,” said Miss Lydia.

“Very happy?” said Emily. “I think it would
be unhappy and difficult. And we can’t take
everything, and give what is less than nothing. And that
is what criticism seems to be. Peter, you do make
me so jealous, sitting there. I wish Nicholas had a
beard, and a kinder expression.”

“Sixty-eight years behind him, and not a
respectable grey hair to show for it!” said Miss Lydia.

Mr. Fletcher passed his hand down his beard.

“Wouldn’t vanity seem to you a feeling
incongruous with your calling?” said Bumpus.

“It would lack, I fear, what may be regarded as
its necessities of life,” said Mr. Fletcher.

“I wish I had said that. I mean, I wish I had
thought of it,” said Emily. “I mean, I wish I had
thought of it just as a cleverness.”

“You see why he will not button his coat,” said
Bumpus. “It would be taking thought for what he
puts on, when he is provided as the lilies of the
field.”

Francis looked grave.

Theresa rose and rang the bell.

“My dear,” said Mr. Fletcher, half rising himself,
“why cannot you say when you want a thing
done?”

{43}“I do it and get back before anyone else is out of
his seat,” said Theresa.

“It is unworthy of you to expect people to be
prompt,” said Bumpus. “Such a cold,
self-esteeming thing to be.”

“I am cold and self-esteeming,” said Theresa.

“It occurs to me,” said Francis, sinking back into
his chair, “that it was just so with my mother. She
used often to vex and grieve me, if it had been
possible for me to be vexed or grieved by her, by
doing for herself those little things that I should have
liked to do for her. I used often to reason with her
about it, but she always refused to hear reason.”

“I must just trot across to the post,” said Miss
Lydia. “I have had to write to all my men, and
tell them that my men’s class will not be held on
Thursday. Dear souls, they will be so disappointed;
but I could not help it, or I would indeed.”

“Let me go for you, Aunt Lyddie,” said Francis.

“No, I am a person who does my own business.
And this business is mine. I am so sad to disappoint
my dear men things, who understand me so. I don’t
often fail them. Not often. And I don’t often fail
with them. I know I am different with women. I
admit it. But men don’t often elude me. Not
often.”

“I feel I do elude Lyddie,” said Emily. “I am
always having proof that I am the average woman.
And Nicholas has taught me to despise it.”

“She seems very pleased with not failing with
men, and failing with women,” said Theresa. “It
would be better not to fail with either.”

{44}“No, if you think a minute, not so good,” said
Emily. “Not so nice, anyhow.”

“I don’t think myself so good,” said Bumpus.
“Much less good, of course.”

“It is something not to fail with one, my dear,”
said Mr. Fletcher.

“I knew you would say that, Peter,” said Theresa.
“You self-righteous, obvious old man. I did not
say it was not.”

“Be patient with me, my dear. I shall be older
and wiser presently.”

“You will be older and not wiser. At our age
people get less wise.”

“Yes, that is true, my dear. I shall do my best
for you, when the time comes for you to consult me
generally.”

Mr. Fletcher’s eyes took on a look of grateful
content, as the door shut on the women. He welcomed
a man’s companionship, and his friendship with
Bumpus gave to his days a hidden light.

“I have been longing to have a word with a
woman,” said Emily, sitting down with Theresa.
“Nicholas is so terribly a man. You must find that
with Peter, too.”

“Sometimes,” said Theresa.

“Only sometimes?” said Emily. “Yes, that is
true about Peter. Nicholas is always a man. Life
is just labour and sorrow for us. Labour for
Nicholas and sorrow for me. You wouldn’t think
that Nicholas would labour. But lately he has. His
way of writing this book is so like what an ordinary
writer’s, a real writer’s way would be. He says it
{45}is ready in his head. Nicholas can’t be like that.
He says it came suddenly to him, when he was sitting
up with Mr. Crabbe. But he must have had it in his
mind; and he has given no sign at all. And Nicholas
ought to have given so many signs. It can’t mean
anything. Do you think him aged lately?”

“No, no, darling,” said Theresa. “Particularly
well and cheerful.”

“That is being so pleased that he is going to be
conspicuous and highly thought of,” said Emily.
“He likes that much more even than the average
man. In some ways Nicholas is built on a very
large scale. I do hope it is all going to come off.
I can hardly tell you how I hope it. He will be
terribly shaken if it does not.”

“Well, why shouldn’t it?” said Theresa. “I
wonder he hasn’t done it before.”

“So do I,” said Emily. “So does he. That is
just it. At least, I don’t think I do, really. I
shouldn’t have thought that Nicholas could write a
book. Not a good book; not even just good
enough.”

“Does your brother know what a good sister he
has in you?” said Theresa.

“No,” said Emily. “He knows what a good
brother I have in him. How I should have had to
go on the streets, or even be a governess, without
him.”

“You had your own income, dear,” said Theresa.

“A hundred a year,” said Emily, “Nicholas is
kind, and without a true dignity. He calls that on
the streets.”

{46}“Well, but there is the other side to it all.”

“Of course there is my side. But Nicholas
doesn’t see that. He is very thorough. He gives
all his attention to one side.”

“You are very devoted to him?” said Theresa.

“You know how I feel to him as well as I do
myself. How utterly I see through him, and yet
how necessary he is to me. And how pathetic. It
will break my heart if this wretched book goes
wrong.”

“Does he feel the same to you? As strongly,
I mean?”

“No,” said Emily. “You know he does not feel
strongly like that about anyone. He is rather glad
he has me. But he has a feeling that without me
he would not have kept a school, and would have
been a real writer. I think it might break him up if
anything were to happen to me. You know that
means if I were to die.”

“He only gives about ten minutes a day to the
school,” said Theresa.

“Well, he couldn’t give any more,” said Emily.
“I did not know you were one of those people who
talk about Nicholas’ ten minutes. And he doesn’t
see the other side. I told you.”

“Have you pointed it out to him, dear?”

“You know that would not make him see it.
Apart from the way he already sees it. And I
believe it is good for him to feel himself a kind of
hero. It holds him up from going down into old
age.”

“What would he do if you married?”

{47}“Live with me, I suppose. As a sort of upper
husband. And look down on the other one.”

“My dear, if you are going to do it, it should be
soon, shouldn’t it? And, as you say, your brother
could live with you.”

“You know I did not say it,” said Emily.
“And as if Nicholas could really live with me, with
somebody else taking some of my attention! You
can’t be as unobservant as that. And if I can
marry now, I can marry at any time. There is not
much dependent on youth left at fifty. And
William gets older at the same time. I don’t
pretend I don’t understand you. I am not at all
commonplace.”

“There is no one else, is there?” said Theresa.

“You should not actually talk to me as the
average married woman thinks of a spinster.”

“Do you ever give him a chance?”

“Give William a chance? I see him every day.”

“But alone, dear? So that he is a free man?”

“In the room that Nicholas and I share, with
Dickie looking on. Where else could I see him?
The boys’ basement dining-room wouldn’t be the
right setting for William. But it wouldn’t make
any difference. He couldn’t propose to me.”

“Why not?”

“Why, I should think he couldn’t. I haven’t
thought about it. I should think it is one of the
things he doesn’t do. We all have them.”

“But you could manage yourself, dear. People
can,” said Theresa.

“Yes, of course they can. I’ve noticed that. And
{48}he would accept me, I am sure. I know he would
spare me embarrassment. Dear William!”

“But he wants to marry you, doesn’t he?”

“As much as he can want to marry anyone.
Anyone who is a woman. And that is not very
much.”

“Oh dear! These dons and people!” said
Theresa.

“Yes, it is something of that way. I knew you
knew all the time. I might tell you it is that way
with me, too. But I shall not tell you any more.
Especially as you are ordinary and know it all. I
understand now why people sometimes murder
people they are known to be fond of. They ought to
murder them.”

“Suppose you outlive your brother, dear?”

“Suppose I outlive him! Why of course I shall
outlive him. I am twenty years younger than he is;
so I mean to live twenty years after him. Don’t you
think a woman ought to live, if there isn’t a man
making use of her?”

“I thought you might not find things worth while
without him. You said he would break up without
you. I shouldn’t like to live for ever, myself.”

“Yes, so I expect he would,” said Emily. “But
then I join him in living for himself. He doesn’t
join me in anything like that. I should love to live
for ever. I don’t wonder that religious people, who
can plan things, arrange it like that.”

“No; but you might not miss him the less for
that,” said Theresa. “We miss what we give most
to, the most.”

{49}“I do not,” said Emily. “I should miss him
the less for that. But I should miss him. That is
why I want this book to come off, so as to give him
a new start of life. And I should live in a nice
little house, if he died. Mr. Merry would have the
school, and make me an allowance. I might have
two sitting-rooms, and I should get so muddled
between them. Where could William propose to
me then? Though of course the school might not
pay without Nicholas. People do admire him so for
giving no time to it. It was so clever of him to think
of it. Anyone else might have thought it would
pay better to give all his time to it.”

“Darby and Joan gossipping together in the
dark!” said Miss Lydia. “Gossipping and
gossipping away in the dark.”

“Well, the dark can soon be remedied,” said
Theresa.

“Yes, yes, it is not incurable,” said Miss Lydia,
feeling for matches as one wont and willing to do all
to be done. “It is not incurable, that is one thing.
Not like the dark in the room I have just been in, a
room under some stairs, with no light, and no fire,
and some little children. Oh, dear! Something
must be done. It must be done. How thankful we
ought to be!”

“With a little less, we should be in the dark and
cold too,” said Theresa. “You could find people
better for preaching thankfulness to.”

“Oh, no. For some people never know how nice
it is to help,” said Miss Lydia. “We ought to be so
sorry for them. Because it is so nice. It is so nice.”

{50}“Perhaps the people are pretending distress out
of kindness to you,” said Theresa.

“No. People are not so difficult in their
kindness,” said Emily. “And they wouldn’t guess it
was nice.”

“Out of kindness to themselves, then,” said
Theresa.

“No, no. Not in this case. No,” said Miss
Lydia. “The man has struggled to get work until
he is hopeless, just to get work, just that, poor soul!
Hopeless and distrustful of everything. He hardly
trusted me at first. But he does now, dear fellow.
Dear fellow, how he does!”

Miss Lydia went to her desk, and stood with her
knuckles on it, her eyes looking into space. The
matter seemed not long without light for her; for
she hastened towards the door.

“What a good soul she is!” said Mr. Fletcher,
smiling, as he came in from seeing Bumpus off in the
hall.

“A soul who ought to be good,” said Theresa.
“No family, and an income of her own! She could
not spend every penny she has on herself.”

“She could not, but there are people who could,
my dear.”

“I could,” said Emily. “I do.”

“Well, it is not for us to admire this dropping of
driblets,” said Theresa. “We had half we had
swallowed at one draught. That was a thing, if you
want one.”

“I wish I had the use of vigorous metaphor,”
said Emily.

{51}“My dear, we did not intend to give it,” said
Mr. Fletcher, who had lent his inheritance, and failed
to recover it.

“No. And so we had all the giving and no
gratitude. That would not suit Lydia.”

“You know,” said Emily, “I hate to say it, but
I believe it would not suit her as badly as most of
us. But very badly, I hope, of course.”

“It did not suit us, did it, Theresa?” said
Mr. Fletcher. “I fear we murmured. I fear
we did.”

“How conceited you are! Of course you did,”
said Emily. “I wonder if Lydia would not have
spoken about it. If so, what a good thing she did
not lose it! We should have had to admire her.”

“It is a good idea to leave debts unpaid when you
die,” said Theresa.

“Very good. I will tell Nicholas about it,” said
Emily. “He very likely has not thought of it.
He is really much more honest than people think.
And he does not think he is going to die. And of
course he is not.”

“My dear, he felt it more than we did,” said
Mr. Fletcher to his wife. “And we have been a
happy old pair without it. Though I don’t know
why I should call myself old, except that I like to be
coupled with you, my dear.”

“I do wish I were not a spinster,” said Emily.
“I retract all I have said.”

“Of course, Lydia flirts with her men,” said
Theresa. “She may not know it, but she does.”

“I wish I could do difficult things without knowing
{52}it,” said Emily. “I always know, when I do them,
so clearly and conceitedly.”

“Well, that kind of thing must be at the bottom
of most things,” said Mr. Fletcher. “It may as
well be put to a good purpose, whether or not people
know it.”

“Peter, you really are rather like other people
sometimes,” said Emily, “though I don’t like to
belittle you before Theresa.”

“Emily, you are sometimes severe,” said Mr.
Fletcher.

“And that is like other people, isn’t it?” said
Emily. “But why should you want not to be like
other people, when you are a good man?”

“I do not want it,” said Mr. Fletcher.

“Then why am I severe?” said Emily. “But
you are right not to let us speak wickedly about
Lydia. It must be terrible to do good.”

{53}## Chapter IV

“Now, I don’t know how it is,” said Mr. Merry,
“but you all look half-dressed, and in a state of
slovenliness, somehow. I can’t understand how it
is that my boys cannot manage to look like
gentlemen. Now, whatever is it so scrappy and untidy
about you all?”

“We are to dress again, sir, presently,” said a
boy; “before the prize-giving!”

“Dress again, presently, before the prize-giving!
Dress again, presently, before the prize-giving!
Dress again presently! And so it is not worth while
to come down looking like gentlemen, though there
are five or six hours before the prize-giving begins!
Have any of you washed this morning, pray?
Have you washed, Johnson? Have any of you said
your prayers? Or have you put them off, till you
shall be in church in four days’ time? I have never
heard of such a thing.”

“Miss Basden told us to—to do those things, and
then not very much. We are to change all our
things again presently. Miss Basden said——”

“Miss Basden said! Miss Basden said! You are
a lot of boys to require a lady to come and say that
kind of thing to you! Have you no gentlemanly
sense of decency? Have you no self-respect?
{54}Have you no...? Oh, I have no patience to talk
to you. I cannot understand it. I cannot. When
I was your age...But get to your books, and let
me hear no more of this dressing again presently
because of the prize-giving. I cannot put up with
it.”

A maid appeared with a request from Mrs. Merry,
that the boys would go down to breakfast directly
they heard the gong, as there was no time to spare
that morning.

“Yes! Oh; what, Fanny? Directly they hear
the gong? Thank you, Fanny, very much. Boys,
you go down to breakfast directly you hear the gong.
So don’t stay behind to finish what you are doing;
and to let me go out first, as I am forty years older
than you, and your schoolmaster. I suppose Mother
thought you would miss out hearing the gong this
morning, as you have missed out most other things.
And there is the gong! So rush down; and go
stampeding like a heard of tatterdemalions who have
never been to school, instead of gentlemen spending
their lives in one.”

Mrs. Merry was sitting before an empty tray,
looking as if she had given up hope, except in smoothing
her hair and glancing at the clock.

“Now, Mother, now, it’s all right, Mother,” said
Mr. Merry, in an almost imploring tone. “You
are managing it all as well as it can possibly be
managed. You know you are, Mother.”

“But it is not all right, dear. The cups cannot
be done without. The boys have to have their
breakfast as usual,” said Mrs. Merry, almost
{55}implying that it would be only reasonable to waive
this material start to the day.

“Oh, yes; ring the bell, Johnson,” said Mr.
Merry, avoiding looking at his wife. “Ring the
bell, Johnson, will you, please? Thank you,
Johnson, very much. Oh, Miss Basden, good morning,
Miss Basden. We were getting to feel all of a muddle
without you.”

“You will have to feel all of a muddle again,
very soon, then, I am afraid, Mr. Merry. I have
come in only to rush away again. Oh, the cups!
I could not be there for once. No, Mrs. Merry, I
insist upon your not getting up. Mr. Merry, will
you please forbid Mrs. Merry to rise?”

“Boys, go out and get your own cups for your
own breakfast! Get up, and wait upon yourselves.
When I was a boy, there was none of this sitting
about of boys to be waited on. Oh, Fanny! Here
you are, Fanny. The cups, Fanny, please. They
have been forgotten somehow, in the bustle about
everything to-day, you know. It is all right, Fanny.
Thank you, Fanny, very much. Boys, be still, and
don’t first sit about to have everything done for you,
and then when it is being done, begin to make a fuss.
Can’t you see that Fanny is getting the cups for you
now? Oh, you are a set of boys! Now, Mother,
have a cup of tea, and let your mind rest, while you
have your breakfast. Miss Basden, you do the
same.”

“It is more pouring out three or four dozen cups
of tea for other people, than having one cup myself,
that I have to think about.”

{56}“Yes, Mother, yes,” said Mr. Merry, looking
guiltily at the array of cups. “You are always
looking after three or four dozen people, it seems
to me. But don’t give up heart, Mother, you know.
All days are not like to-day, you know. Why,
Mr. Burgess! How are you, Mr. Burgess? Why,
you look as fresh as if you were to have a prize.
Ah! Anything out of the common is a great thing
for you, isn’t it, Mr. Burgess?”

“Well, it depends upon how much it has to do
with me, Mr. Merry,” said Mr. Burgess, who had
come in brighter for the break in routine, but was
already at his level. “It sounds rather a confession,
but I am afraid I had not thought of the boys’
prize-giving. It was very self-centred of me.”

“It has brought you down in time, Mr. Burgess,
at any rate,” said Miss Basden, draining her cup
on her feet.

“I had not thought of it, Miss Basden. But I am
glad, if I have even unconsciously honoured the day.”

“Ah, Mr. Burgess, it would not bring you down
earlier, would it?”

“It appears that it has, Mr. Merry. But it was
an office performed for me quite without my own
participation, as I say; though it seems these things
are to be settled for me.”

“Boys, now, will you all be in your rooms by
half-past eleven?” said Miss Basden, in a sudden,
aloof tone, from the door. “By half-past eleven;
so that you can have done all you have to do, by
twelve, when I shall come round and see that you
are properly ready. Do you understand?”

{57}“Can’t any of you speak?” said Mr. Merry.
“Can’t you do something else than sit, when a lady
makes kind proposals of this sort to you? What do
any of you ever do for Miss Basden, that she should
go round, when she has so much to do, and see that
you are all ready? Now, thank Miss Basden; and
say that, of course, you will be ready to the
moment.”

“Fanny,” said Mrs. Merry, “will you remember
that I shall want you all down in the basement this
morning? So none of you are to be upstairs at all,
after the rooms are done. Miss Herrick is answering
the front door bell.”

“What, Mother?” said Mr. Merry, leaning to
his wife. “Miss Herrick, Mother? Miss Herrick
answering the front door bell! Why, is that
necessary, Mother? Does Mr. Herrick know about
that?”

“Quite necessary, dear; or I should not have
arranged it.”

“Yes, but Mother, Miss Herrick! Miss Herrick,
you know! Why, I should not have thought
that...I mean, is that all right, Mother?”

“Quite, dear. It is just a little arrangement
between Miss Herrick and me.”

“Yes, Mother,” said Mr. Merry, with compliment
in his tone towards his wife’s relation with the sister
of the head. “But, you know, Mother! Well,
wasn’t there any way at all out of it but that?”

“None at all, dear. Unless you can spare me
one of the boys, to sit in the hall all the morning
and answer the bell?”

{58}“Oh, well, Mother! I don’t mean that they
wouldn’t be a great deal more useful, sitting in the
hall, and answering the bell, than doing anything
they will be doing. For what will be the good of
teaching them this morning, sitting patiently and
trying to teach them, half dressed as they are, and
their heads full of every kind of thing but what they
ought to be full of? But you know, Mother”—Mr.
Merry spoke low—“the parents, you know! If it
got to them, all about being used, and missing a
morning’s work, you know! So I don’t think,
Mother...”

“Oh, of course I didn’t really mean it, dear!”
said Mrs. Merry, half laughing. “And a boy
would not be any good to me, really.”

“No. A boy would not be any good to you,
really! A boy would not be of any good to you!
Oh, wouldn’t he? I am sure he would not. Now
there is a thing to get about, about you all! Here
is Mother, kind as she is, having to say that!”

“You might stay with the boys until they have
finished their breakfast, dear,” said Mrs. Merry,
speaking with her hand on the edge of the table;
“and then get them out as soon as possible. We are
not going to have prayers this morning, so that the
maids can get in to clear the room.”

Mr. Merry waited with his eyes on the door, until
it closed behind his wife.

“Not going to have prayers this morning! Oh!
So you are to miss that out, are you, besides all the
other things you have missed out to-day? It seems
that the only things you are to have to-day, are meals
{59}and prizes. I don’t wonder that the custom of giving
prizes is getting to be talked against. I don’t wonder.
And I tell you, there is one thing you will have this
morning, and that is your work. So get up, and get
out, whether you have finished your breakfast or not.
‘Stay with the boys until they have finished their
breakfast!’ Am I a nursemaid, or what? Why,
Mother is all put about this morning. So get out,
and get your walk, and come back prepared to give
your mind to your books. Do you hear me?”

“The end of breakfast is another thing that we can
miss out to-day,” said Mr. Burgess, implying personal
indifference.

“Oh, well, Mr. Burgess,” said Mr. Merry, his
eyes on the departing flock of boys; “oh, well, the
boys needn’t hurry you. But ‘stay with the boys
until they have finished their breakfast!’ Why, I
shouldn’t have dreamt of asking you to do it,
Mr. Burgess.”

Mr. Burgess followed his pupils.

“Fanny,” said Mr. Merry, “this about Miss
Herrick’s answering the bell? Why, that is all
right, of course? There isn’t any way out of it?
There isn’t any one of you who could just run upstairs,
you know, if you should hear the bell?”

“Well, no, I am afraid not, sir. Mrs. Merry’s
orders are, that we are to keep downstairs this
morning. There is a lot to be done down there.”

“Yes, Fanny, of course. Yes, Fanny. Thank
you, Fanny, very much.”

Mr. Merry went up to the hall, and catching sight
of Emily, quickened his steps to overtake her.

{60}“Why, Miss Herrick, here is our great day. Our
great day for the lads, when we all work together, as
you and Mr. Herrick are so kind to us. And, Miss
Herrick, you are so very kind to us. I hope there
isn’t any little thing you are doing for us to-day that
will be a nuisance to you, you know?”

“Oh, no. Nicholas and I are just coming in, in
our most beautiful clothes, when the people come.
What could be nicer for us? And I am opening the
front door, as we can hear the bell. But as the
tradesmen go to the back, and no visitors come in the
morning, I don’t know whom I am to open it to.
Unless to Mr. Burgess and the boys. That would
sound good work, if I just said the number of people.”

“Yes, Miss Herrick,” said Mr. Merry, making
way rather hurriedly for Emily. “Yes, Miss Herrick,
very good and kind to us all. Oh, Mr. Burgess!
So you are not gone, Mr. Burgess. Then make sure
that you have your latch key, Mr. Burgess, will you?
Because there is a good deal of running about on
people to-day, you know.”

“Yes, Mr. Merry, I believe I have it. I always
make a point of carrying it. A latch key is a useful
thing to have on one, in case of wanting to run in
and out.”

“Oh, well, Mr. Burgess. Wanting to run in and
out! Oh, well, just to-day I meant, you know.”

A few hours later Emily opened the door to
Bumpus and Masson.

“So you are not ashamed of coming to see us when
we are really helping to earn the living. I mean of
being seen with us. Did you see Mr. Burgess
{61}passing the college this morning, with his paper,
and all the boys? How young did you think he
looked?”

“About twenty,” said Bumpus. “A nice boy.”

“Oh, you don’t think he looks as young as that?
Nicholas, here is Dickie saying that Mr. Burgess
looks about twenty, and a nice boy! And he is here
to look quite apart from the boys. It is so worrying
about the parents noticing how young he is. With
Nicholas doing nothing, and Mr. Merry’s having no
education, there is only Mr. Burgess to be looked to
for all the boys’ advantages. Of course Miss Basden
is better than all three of them. But parents don’t
count a woman.”

“That is unreasonable of them,” said Bumpus,
“as one out of every pair of them is a woman.”

“Perhaps that is how they know,” said Emily.
“But Mr. Burgess only missed a year of college
because he couldn’t afford to be kept there, and he
has been here eighteen months; so he really might be
doing something now.”

“Has he no degree, then?” said Bumpus.

“Yes, he worked for it during the first year he was
here.”

“I did not know you could do that for Oxford or
Cambridge,” said Masson.

“I don’t think it was Oxford or Cambridge,”
said Emily. “Don’t be searching and snobbish,
William.”

“Well, missing the culminating part of advantages
does not show,” said Bumpus.

“Not very much, to parents, I hope. It is only
{62}Mr. Merry who really shows how much he has
missed; and Mr. Merry can do anything. Isn’t it
generous of him to spend his life giving to others
what he has not had himself?”

“Why not hand over prayers to him, and retire,
Herrick?” said Bumpus. “If he can read.”

“It might be bold to make any change,” said
Masson.

“And boldness in religion is out of place,” said
Emily, “when we have to be humiliated and lowly.
Mr. Merry can read. I saw him once, reading.
But of course Nicholas has to read prayers. You
must see that, Dickie.”

“Yes, yes. I see that, really,” said Bumpus.

“You were obvious, Richard,” said Masson.

“Dear Mr. Merry!” said Emily. “He is not
obvious, is he? To support us all, so that people
think it is Nicholas! I really don’t think it is
obvious.”

“It is in good taste,” said Herrick.

“You do your half, darling,” said Emily. “It
is all a matter of the time people take. There are
those hundreds of helpless children, coming up from
that cellar that we have never seen. I wish Dickens
was alive, to expose schools. Mr. Merry has stopped
to look back at Mrs. Merry, as if she were a dumb
pet that understood.”

“I can understand Merry, too,” said Bumpus.

“I believe you can,” said Emily. “That is a
side I do so admire in you. We must go after them,
Nicholas, and walk about, with you in your gown.
It makes me feel homesick that Mr. Merry shouldn’t
{63}work any harder than the rest of us. And it is so
humiliating that he hasn’t a gown. I wish I could
mend your coat, darling. It is really undignified
for you to have your clothes mended by Mrs. Merry,
as if you were one of the boys.”

“They know we can’t help me,” said Herrick.
“But Burgess can be helped, and he looks himself
as if he wished he looked older.”

“Well, his heart is in the right place,” said
Bumpus.

“And after all, they would know that we shouldn’t
have anyone really mature for him,” said Emily.
“But he copies Nicholas, so that they know that
Nicholas’ influence permeates the school; and that
is bad. And then they ask, and find it doesn’t, and
that again is bad.”

“Fletcher is to give the prizes,” said Herrick.
“It has to be a parson. I don’t know why.”

“Well, God does like reward,” said Bumpus.

“It is a great thing that Burgess at his age isn’t
a parson,” said Masson.

“It is a great success for him. I wonder if he
thought of it, himself,” said Bumpus. “Of course
he did not have to think of it.”

“I wish Mr. Merry did not look so affectionately
at the boys,” said Emily. “It makes Nicholas look
so dreadful by comparison. And we don’t realize
how bad I look by Mrs. Merry; so unmotherly. And
suppose anyone should take Mr. Burgess for a boy,
or forget Miss Basden!”

“Does Miss Basden not like being forgotten?”
said Masson, as one not disliking this himself.

{64}“She is morbid about it,” said Bumpus. “I
have not spoken to her, but I can see that.”

“Don’t be superior to women, and more so to
those who earn their living, Dickie,” said Emily.
“It is so revealing of you. And not spoken to
Miss Basden, when but for her you would have to
support most of your nearest friends! You would
find it so difficult to do it too. I believe Miss Basden
does it.”

“Will there be a great crowd?” said Herrick.

“Well, we ought to want that,” said Masson.

“How generously you both identify yourself with
us!” said Emily. “Most of the parents are coming.
I hope it doesn’t mean that they want to look into
things, or reassure themselves, or anything like
that.”

“Will you make the speech on the spur of the
moment, Herrick?” said Masson.

“Nicholas can’t spend his genius on speeches for
boys,” said Emily. “He has his book to give it to.”

“People don’t really make speeches on the spur
of the moment,” said Bumpus. “Merry will
make it.”

“I thought an outsider always made the speech,”
said Masson; “that the schoolmaster’s business was
not to praise his own school, and all that.”

“You thought Merry’s business was not that?”
said Bumpus. “Then what did you think his
business was?”

“You know an outsider is not called in here to do
anything,” said Emily. “Mr. Merry does it. And
you should not call Nicholas an outsider, when our
{65}business to-day is to prove that he is not one. Now
we must go and serve under Mr. Merry.”

“They also serve who only stand and wait,”
said Bumpus.

“Don’t notice it when you see Nicholas not being
himself,” said Emily. “His real self really doesn’t
do. And go up and shake hands with Miss Basden.
And don’t be arch and joking with Mr. Burgess, as
if he were young.”

Mrs. Merry and Miss Basden were talking in easy
tones, with a nervous unconsciousness of what they
said.

“How do you do, Miss Herrick?” said Mrs.
Merry.

“Oh, Mrs. Merry, what are you doing?” said
Miss Basden.

“Poor Miss Herrick, to be forgotten!” said
Mr. Burgess, advancing to Emily with his hands
under his gown, and drawing Mr. Merry’s glance.

“Oh, really, Miss Herrick! Well! What am I
doing? It is the idea of shaking hands with so many
people.”

“Yes, Mother,” said Mr. Merry, uneasily.

Herrick stepped on to the platform in gown and
hood, his expression inviting attention to himself.
Mr. Burgess, conscious of his similar garb, took his
place near him, and exchanged an easy word. Mr.
Merry, who had no right to a gown and hood, stepped
up after them, and stood surveying his pupils with
an air of fond understanding of boys.

“Now I am not much of a hand at speech-making.
What I do is to teach my boys, and be with my boys,
{66}and give all my time to my boys. But what I want
to say to you all is, that I am glad to see you all
amongst us to-day; that my wife is glad, and my
kind helpers are glad; and Mr. Herrick and Miss
Herrick, whom you have really come to see, of course,
are glad. In fact we are all glad to be together, to
celebrate the good work done by our boys; by your
boys, and by my boys; for I have boys, you know,
though I have only girls, really, if I may be very
Irish for a schoolmaster. And the prizes are not won
only by those who have won them, you know, though
that sounds Irish again; for we don’t overdo things
in the old-fashioned way, you know. So we will see
the prize-winners take their prizes, and the other
prize earners”—Mr. Merry glanced with tender
pride round at the boys—“show how glad they are
that they have won them; which seems to be more
Irish than ever.”

Mr. Merry stepped down amid clapping from the
boys. Mr. Fletcher did his part with covert reference
to a sheet of paper. The youngest boy presented
flowers to Mrs. Merry.

Mrs. Merry took her stand behind a table furnished
by a consistence of fate with cups and an urn.

“Well, Mr. Merry,” said a father, “so you
haven’t put my boy among the prize-winners? Of
course I don’t mean that. But he doesn’t go in for
taking prizes, does he?”

“Ah, your boy,” said Mr. Merry, who knew the
ill policy of honesty with parents; “and a nice boy
too! No, he doesn’t go in for taking prizes. No,
not yet. But I tell you what.” Mr. Merry’s voice
{67}became intimate. “If I had a boy, I should like him
to be your boy. I will tell you that.”

Mr. Merry passed on, and paused at Mrs. Merry’s
table.

“Now, Mother, now, don’t get all into a fuss.
The result of all this will be that you are knocked up.
I can see that.”

Mr. Merry had not meant his words for the general
ear, but had been more occupied with the feelings
which prompted them, than caution in their
utterance.

“Now, Mother, it is all right, Mother. You are
just a little overdone. That is what it is. We know
what it is. We don’t think anything of anything.”
Mr. Merry referred in this way to the fact that
Mrs. Merry was in tears. “It is just because you look
after us all too well. That is what it is.”

“Well, Mr. Merry,” said another father. “And
what have you to say for those two boys of mine?”

“Ah, the little fellows! My wife, she has a
soft spot in her heart for them.”

“And how do they do at their books? John is a
scatterbrain, I am afraid. I suppose these long
holidays nowadays are a good thing?”

“Ah, little John! Well, some boys haven’t the
brains to scatter. And all work and no play, you
know!”

“He would not like to be called little John,” said
a grown-up sister, who was with the father.

“Wouldn’t he?” said Emily. “Not when we
only keep them until they are fourteen! But the
young are cruel.”

{68}“Ah, Miss Herrick, you will talk in your way to
us,” said Mr. Merry. “You know Miss Basden,
do you not, Mr. Bentley?”

“No, I think not,” said Mr. Bentley, simply.

“Why, she is always here, Father. Every
year,” said the daughter. “How are you, Miss
Basden?”

“She is always here. Every year here with us,”
said Mr. Merry, lifting his hands on and off Miss
Basden’s shoulders. “Always here, so that people
don’t notice her any more than they do one of
ourselves. Because she is one of ourselves, if she will
be, aren’t you, Miss Basden?”

“You see the difference between ordinary people
and Mr. Merry,” said Emily to Bumpus. “And
you said you did not know Miss Basden. You rank
with the ordinary people.”

“I always suspected it,” said Bumpus.

“Mr. Herrick is just bringing out another book,
is he not?” said Mr. Bentley. “Is it on any
subject that the boys could get any—be interested in
now, I mean?”

“Oh well, well, you know, if Mr. Herrick wrote
on a subject, then the book would not be his own.
And that would not do for Mr. Herrick. And writing
for boys! Well, we could not expect that from him.
But there is our atmosphere; our thing that we have
to give, that other schools don’t give. And that only
Mr. Herrick can do for us. Ah, and he does it for
us. I wish I had had it in my young days. Then
I might not have been the schoolmaster now. I
might have been the other thing. And I hope your
{69}laddies will be it. I do hope it. And, bless them,
I shouldn’t be surprised.”

Mr. Merry wrung Mr. Bentley’s hand.

“Well, Mr. Burgess, so you are going about, are
you, Mr. Burgess? Now what about this theory that
we don’t want long holidays? That is not quite on
your line, is it?”

“Well, I dare say there is something in it, Mr.
Merry. When I first became a schoolmaster, I
thought I should never get used to the breaks from
work. But I confess I am becoming reconciled.
That is the way of schoolmasters, I fear.”

“Oh, well, that is one kind of talk, Mr. Burgess.
But what would you have done, now, if you had not
become a schoolmaster?”

“Oh, you are off the point, Mr. Merry.”

“Not at all, not at all. What would you have
done, now, if you had not taken up
schoolmastering?”

“No, no, off the point, Mr. Merry.”

“Mr. Burgess seems deeply attached to the
point,” said Miss Basden.

“It should attract even the humblest
educationist, Miss Basden,” said Mr. Burgess, bowing.

“Well, Mr. Merry is an educationist, I suppose
you will admit?” said Miss Basden.

“Surely,” said Mr. Burgess.

“Ah, we understand each other, don’t we,
Mr. Burgess?” said Mr. Merry. “With your kind
help, Miss Basden, and all you do for all of us.”

“Well, it wasn’t quite so degrading as usual, was
it?” said Emily, as the four settled into Herrick’s
{70}study. “Nobody spoke to me like an employer.
Did anybody to you, Nicholas?”

“It went off admirably,” said Herrick.
“Admirably. I quite enjoyed it. I should feel
quite proud of the school, as I thought a school a
thing to be proud of. And Merry surpassed
himself.”

“I saw you enjoying it,” said Emily. “I saw
you being proud of the school, too. That was
charming of you. But I followed the workings of
Mr. Merry’s mind too sensitively for enjoyment. A
great mind on the rack would be a dreadful thing to
enjoy. And he did not always surpass himself. He
was really indefinite with Mr. Bentley about his
boys.”

“Oh, only with that kind of fellow,” said
Herrick.

“How can you be so reckless?” said Bumpus.
“Or is that the attitude that makes for success?”

“With Merry behind, it will do,” said Herrick.

“We shall have to propitiate Mr. Bentley,” said
Emily. “I am afraid it will not do, darling.
Mr. Bentley isn’t so fond of your having Mr. Merry
behind as you think.”

“How will you do that?” said Bumpus. “By
having Merry qualify?”

“By asking Mr. Bentley to dinner,” said Emily.
“Being for an evening with Nicholas teaches people
better than anything. And it is difficult for them to
behave like employers when they have been our
guests. We ought to have him while the house is
disarranged; and we will ask the Fletchers too.”

{71}“Is a disarranged house better for a dinner?”
said Masson.

“Yes,” said Emily. “This room has to be
regarded as the drawing-room, and a classroom
made into the dining-room, and the boys’ basement
dining-room suppressed, to have anything at all.
And Mrs. Merry can’t be asked to do that
often.”

“No, no,” said Herrick.

“You will have to ask her about the dinner,
darling,” said Emily. “She never can speak to
you, so she won’t be able to say words of refusal.”

“Why cannot you ask her as often as you want,
if she can’t say words of refusal?” said Bumpus.

“You are so unmanly about Mrs. Merry, Dickie,”
said Emily.

“I feel rather unmanly about her,” said Bumpus.

“I feel unmanly in asking her this,” said
Herrick.

“You think it is unwomanly of me to ask you to,”
said Emily. “But I have not the true courage that
is womanly. It is being so much with men. But
how you do realize the domestic problem, Nicholas!
You are better than either Dickie or William at that.
I think it must mean that you have the mixture of
the feminine and masculine, known to be in genius.
I feel so hopeful about your book.”

“Ah, Herrick, the time for our exposure gets near,
doesn’t it?” said Bumpus.

“Yes, yes, it does,” said Herrick. “It does get
near, indeed. And it will be something of an
exposure for me. Because my book brings out really
{72}a new self in me, a self that I was hardly conscious
was there, myself.”

“Yes, books do come out queerly in that way,”
said Bumpus. “Now my book shows an old side of
me; a young side, I might say, that I thought had
been covered up for twenty years. I wonder if any
of you will find my old self in it.”

“I suppose that is the difference between an
author and an ordinary man,” said Emily.
“Because of course there must be some difference.
An author does things from a new self or an old self,
and an ordinary man just from his ordinary self, as
if he were doing an ordinary thing, which of course
he is. I am glad that Nicholas’ is the new self,
because his early one might not make a book quite
suitable for a schoolmaster, for a schoolmaster to
write.”

“Do you remember, how Herrick once said he
could live without Emily?” said Masson, as he and
Bumpus left the house.

“William,” said Bumpus, “you know there is a
thing I will do for you, if you want it done? If you
want to marry Emily, it could be easily managed
about Herrick. You might have to live with him.
That would be easy. Or he could live with you.
That would be easy. You are a rich man. I mean,
I would bring the thing to Emily, if you would find
less surface trouble so. I could bring her mind in
turn to you. I would do my best, I would do well,
between you.”

“Richard, I will say it to you,” said Masson. “I
am grateful enough, to understand you. I know
{73}what you think it might mean of change for you. I
would accept it, if I needed it. I would take
anything from you. But if I had wished to marry
Emily, if she had wished to marry me; I will say
the first; it would have been enough; I should have
asked her many years ago. I should not have
thought of Herrick, to be plain. I should ask her
now, if the desire came to me. I should ask her
myself, like the ordinary man I am.”

“Of course you would,” said Bumpus. “I see
now. I never saw before. But I meant well. Oh,
but I believe you know how well I meant.”

“I would take anything from you,” said Masson.
“But I would have you understand my feeling for
Emily. I have all you supposed I might have for
her. And I hope she has something for me. I hope
and believe it. For it means a great thing in my
life for me. But you are the more necessary to me,
as her brother is to her. That is not to say that you
and he are exactly first to either of us. Do you
see?”

“Yes,” said Bumpus. “I think I have always
seen.”

{74}## Chapter V

“Are the boys coming?” said the Reverend Henry
Bentley.

“They are out of their room, Father,” said his
daughter.

“I asked you if they were coming.”

“They are out of their room, Father. We are all
a little late this morning.”

“I know we are late. I asked you if they were
coming.”

Mr. Bentley rang the bell, and took his seat. He
was an upright, white-haired man in the fifties. He
had been a parson and a younger son, and had come
later into the family estate.

Two boys of twelve and thirteen edged into the
room, with the words, “Good morning, Father.”

Mr. Bentley simply turned his eyes on them; and
the younger showed the behaviour natural to
continual gratitude, by vaguely capering.

The daughter was a tall young woman of thirty,
with a pointed chin, and a small, compressed,
peaceful mouth. She was the child of Mr. Bentley by an
earlier marriage. He was a widower for the second
time.

“I am sorry we are late, Father.”

{75}Mr. Bentley did not look at her. He bowed his
head over the breakfast with an air of not sharing
the general thanklessness. Delia raised her head a
little after the rest. There was a suggestion about
her of remembering their being late.

“We shall have a windy walk to the college
chapel,” said Mr. Bentley.

“What did you say, Father?” said Delia.

Mr. Bentley did not answer.

“We shall have a windy walk to the chapel,” he
presently said, in a still lower voice.

“What did you say, Father?”

Mr. Bentley did not answer.

“Would you like lunch at one or half-past,
Father?”

Mr. Bentley was silent.

“Would you like lunch at one or half-past,
Father?”

Mr. Bentley was silent.

“Father, I think you heard me.”

“Since it is the fashion this morning to be deaf,
I may as well follow it. I might ask how many
people had heard me.”

“How late you were home last night, Father!
Was the train delayed?”

“I walked from the station. The train was not
delayed. It is not a distance one can walk in a
minute.”

“You are so good in those ways, Father. We all
ought to copy you.”

“I might as well not go on trying to do my best
in any way, for all the attention that is paid to me.
{76}I am getting tired of things. I cannot say that I
am not. And as for copying me, other people in my
house certainly should not do less than I. John, if
you cannot control your fidgetting, you must go. I
cannot bear it.”

There was a long silence.

“Have you not a word to say this morning,
Harry? Nobody would think that I went to the
expense of sending you to Mr. Herrick’s, to see you
sitting there like a stock, as if you could not open
your mouth.”

“No, I have nothing to say, Father.”

Mr. Bentley looked round.

“Do not think of letting me keep you, Father,”
said Delia.

“I am not able to think of it. I am going to my
writing. I have a good deal to do before chapel.
That will give you time.”

Mr. Bentley’s writing was held to have bearing on
his property, and it gave him the position of the
breadwinner.

When they were returning from the chapel, Mr.
Bentley spoke.

“An intellectual fellow, the chaplain. He gives
you a sermon to think over, a sermon with some
stuff in it. I dare say it is natural that the boys
should not care to listen to him.”

Delia was silent.

“Really, I shall be glad when their self-absorption
gets to such a pitch, that I am justified in closing
my doors to them. I am beginning to feel that they
have spoilt my home long enough.”

{77}Delia was silent, and Mr. Bentley turned back to
the boys.

“Come, come, walk a little more briskly, and as
if you were not so utterly given up to self-indulgence.
Ah! self-indulgence is a thing I am not enough
down upon in my family.”

When the lunch was brought, the elder boy did
not see. Mr. Bentley came to the table slowly, his
expression unsympathetic towards any promptness.

“Harry, pray stop swinging your foot in that
worrying manner.”

“Oh, I did not notice,” said the boy. “Did you
speak to me?”

“I do not think I did. I believe we have not
spoken since we came in. But I wonder what kind
of an experience it is, never to be awake, or alive
to anything outside oneself. I wonder what the
result would have been, if I had spent my life in a
state of lethargy, with no thought for anything
outside myself. It would have been a nice thing for
other people. Really, sometimes I get tired of
denying myself, and wishing for nothing for my
own life, and meeting simply with the kind of thing
that I meet with.”

“Is it I who have brought this on everyone,
Father?”

“Is it you? Oh, yes, you are sure to be the
prominent figure in your own view of anything.”

“I cannot alter my nature,” muttered the boy.

“Your nature! Even when you open your
mouth, it is the same. You can, of course, adapt
yourself to other people, as we all do, as I have done
{78}through my life, more than you could ever realize.
If I had had visions about my nature, I do not know
what would have become of all of you.”

There was again silence.

“What was the text, Harry?” said Mr. Bentley.

Harry answered rightly.

“John, what was the text?”

John gave a start, and lifted his eyes to the
ceiling, and his father looked away from him.

The family settled to books.

“What are you reading, John?”

John made a reply.

“I hope you are really reading it?”

“Oh, yes.”

“And what is your book, Harry?”

Harry rose and offered the book to his father.

Mr. Bentley glanced at it, and went to his desk.
His pen caught the paper.

“Another pen,” he said, turning his eyes on his
elder son, but somehow held from the use of his
name.

“Harry, are you deaf, and too self-indulgent to
stir?”

There was a silence.

“Boys,” said Mr. Bentley, his eyes still on his
pen, “you seem to make it a custom now to be with
us on Sunday afternoons. I have said nothing of
it that I can remember. As you are not of much
good to anyone, I think we have perhaps had
enough of you.”

The boys disappeared.

“Father, need you write any more to-day?”
{79}said Delia, later. “You will be quite tired before
the week begins. Is it necessary?”

“Urgent business letters about the property which
we are living on, are necessary. I should not have
done any work to-day, if I had felt I could leave it.”

“Are you going to do anything to-night,
Father?”

“No, I think I have done enough for one day,
especially as I shall have to be up and about by
seven o’clock to-morrow.”

Mr. Bentley had chosen the morrow for an
inspection of his estate, that is, he would rise to his
duty while his family lay at ease.

“It is eight o’clock, Delia,” he said, as if the
evening meal’s not being ready to the moment was
not to be conceived.

Mr. Bentley carved as one not shirking daily
burdens, by reason of a particular one about to fall
upon him.

“What were you doing all the time you were
upstairs, Harry?”

“Oh, different things, Father.”

“What things?”

“Oh, just little, ordinary things, Father.”

“What things? You must know what you have
been doing?”

“I have not been doing anything in particular.
We were only upstairs a few hours, Father.”

“I do not require you to tell me how long you
were upstairs. And I should like to know when you
will do something, Harry. Just suppose that I
spent my life without ever doing anything. There
{80}would be a very different life for you, to going
every day to Mr. Herrick’s, and having money
spent on you without any trouble for yourself.
You would soon get to know the difference, very
soon.”

Next morning Mr. Bentley came slowly down his
staircase. He was late for his train, his reason for
further delay. He walked to his place with an air of
uncertainty whether to remain.

“Ring the bell, Harry,” he said, replacing a
cover on a dish, and leaning back to read a letter.

“Is it too cold for you, Father?” said Delia.
“We kept on and on expecting you, and wondering
whether to send it down to be kept hot. But I was
afraid it would get too dry.”

“Your wondering whether to send it down to be
kept hot, was not of much good, if you had made
up your mind it would get too dry,” said Mr.
Bentley. He paused once or twice in his speech, and
did not lift his eyes.

“I did not think you would be so long, Father.
You were so nearly ready when I passed your
room.”

Mr. Bentley gave a casual glance at his daughter.
He had done what remained with the utmost slowness,
and a bitter sense of lookers-on.

“Take this down, and do me some fresh,” he
said to the maid.

“Delia, can we go?” said Harry.

“Ask father if he will excuse you,” said Delia.

“Father, can we go? It is past school-time.”

“If it is past school-time, why did you not ask to
{81}go at the proper time? Why ask at all, if not at
the right time? And using that ridiculous voice,
as if there were some benefit to me in your sitting
there! You are here to satisfy your own appetites.
Go, of course. I do not want you.”

Mr. Bentley observed his sons as they left the
room.

“I have never met a man so unfortunate in
his children. Self-conscious, conceited, with the
manners of clowns! Sitting there, thinking their
society such a benefit, and then the first words they
utter to do with themselves! Neither of them
taking the trouble to say good morning to me, but
speaking fast enough as soon as they wanted to get
off to their own pursuits! It is unbelievable.”

“I do not think Harry is well. I think he has
one of his headaches coming. I have thought so
all breakfast time.”

“And why did you not speak of it, if you saw
it? Why did you sit there and take no notice of a
child you knew to be ill? Really, Delia, I should
not have believed it. It is a hard thing, a hard
thing, a hard thing. I may not have done much to
lead my children as I would have them go, but my
example should not have led them to this. It
should not.”

Delia rose and left the room.

Mr. Bentley was about to follow her, when she
re-entered, forcing him to pause. He stood with his
head and arms so rigid that they shook. Delia
edged by him, and stood with her eyes on his
face.

{82}“Come, speak, Delia. Do not be mysterious.
It is the worst breach of manners. What secret can
there be?”

“Can I speak to you, Father?”

“Speak? Of course you can speak. Do get out
of this way of making mysteries. Speak, and try
to be natural and to the point.”

“John and Harry have come home, Father.
They want to speak to you, I think.”

“Want to speak to me! Want to speak! Of all
the habits my family has ever had! Call them in,
and let them speak, make them speak. I will have
no more of it. It makes me too ashamed.”

“Let me pass, will you please, Father.”

“Oh, it is nothing that requires anyone to be
put about for it. They have come back because
they ‘want to speak,’ I believe. My children are
fond of that plea.”

“Father, we must see if anything is the matter
with them.”

“Harry! John! Come in at once, and tell
your sister what you want with her.”

“Well, what is it that you have to say, that you
have come home from school when the morning has
hardly begun? Let us hear it, so that you can get
back again. I do not like this easy breaking off for
any reason that comes to hand.”

“I have a headache,” said Harry. “Mrs. Merry
sent us home to tell Delia.”

Delia went out of the room with the boy.

“John, go after your sister, and come back at
once, and tell me all about your brother, I must
{83}know if I am needed. I will put off my journey
to-day.”

“You will not be needed. Harry did not even
want you to be told.”

“Oh, you idiotic, self-absorbed children! Have
you not reason to grasp, that it is what is good for
Harry that has to be thought of? Can you not
bring yourselves to some real concern for your
brother? Must you go on, thinking of nothing but
how things can be settled for you to see the least
trouble? Oh, that I could get you to see it! But
I have given it up. As I say, I will give up my
journey to-day. I will be ready to hear what is
best to do, and ready to do it.”

John gave a caper.

“You see, John, it is not always an easy thing
to bring people to see what is right, when one is at
the head of a household where people are fond of
going their own way, whether it is the right way or
not. It cannot be done, my boy, without much of
what must seem to people who do not
understand—and my family are people who do not understand, I
am sorry to say—to be needless, and even trying.
But you will look back upon what your father did,
when I am no longer with you, and see that it was
not done easily.”

John looked at his father with rising tears.

Mr. Bentley just laid a hand on his head, and
went upstairs and stood by himself, repeating his
speech with additions which had not occurred to
him.

When he went down later, he saw that his
{84}daughter had dropped a spoon she had brought from
the sick room. He watched her look with a resolve
not to help the search, and sat down and opened the
paper.

“Well, I have to go on under this fresh burden of
anxiety. It is not an easy thing to do, for anyone
who cannot sink at once into his own affairs. Ah,
it is a sad thing in many ways to be wrought upon
by things outside oneself.”

“I am sure we all feel about Harry. But he is
not really ill. And it is hardly right to make a
great trouble of a little one.”

“You are a self-satisfied young woman.”

“Self-satisfied? Oh, you do not know me, I
think, Father. And I am sure I have no right to be
self-satisfied. I am many things I should not be.
I am quite conscious of that.”

“You are a wonderful young woman, to be
conscious that you are not perfect.”

“I think we are all rather out of sorts, and strung
up, so to speak, about it.”

“It is a great thing if Harry gets over this,” said
Mr. Bentley. “It is hardly to be expected, I
suppose, in such a case of neglect, though of course
it is right to do everything as if we did expect it.”

There was silence.

“Well, upon my word, you all make life very
hard for a man. I do not know what I have done,
that I should be subjected to this. Here I have
done my best for all these years, gone on doing all
I could do; never lost patience; never dwelt upon
what I might have had. And now, because I try
{85}to keep a wise and firm hand over people for their
own good, and to prevent them from sinking down,
down, down, for their own sakes—whose, if not for
theirs, I should like to know?—to be given as much
to bear as if I were a tyrant and a monument of
selfishness, instead of...! Oh, it will not bear
discussing. Why should I discuss it? Some
people have much from others, and some have
nothing and give all. It is just that, I suppose.”

“There is John come in again from school,”
said Delia. “I will go out and tell him not to
come in.”

Delia was capable of revenge.

“Oh, what does it matter whether he comes in or
not?” said Mr. Bentley, his eyes dilating. “That
is not the sort of thing to give our thought to now.
It is not a time for thinking about nothing.”

Delia turned to the door.

“John,” called Mr. Bentley, “come into the
room, and hear what there is to be heard about
Harry. It is not right that you should not hear of
your own brother. I will have no concealments and
associations on false pretences in my family. Ah!
That is what makes family breaches. That is what
leads to them.”

“Did you call me, Father? I had gone upstairs.
I was not quite sure.”

“You heard me call, I suppose?”

“Yes, Father. That is why I came down.”

“Then I imagine you were sure. Really, John,
you talk as if you were not in your right mind. I
suppose, after all, you are too stupid, and childish
{86}for your age to be told anything, even what it is not
right that you should not know. Go away, then.
Go away to your own concerns. I will not tell you,
then.”

At this point the maid brought in a note of
concern from Emily.

“Do you see much of Mr. Herrick and Miss
Herrick?” said Mr. Bentley, when he had read it.

“No, Father.”

“How much do you see of them? You know
what I mean.”

“Not—not much, not at all, Father.”

“Do you see anything of anyone, may I ask?
Does anyone have anything to do with you? Teach
you, for instance?”

“Mr. Merry, and Mr. Burgess, and Miss Basden;
and Mrs. Merry, sometimes.”

“I think Miss Herrick is very charming,” said
Delia.

“Oh, don’t be so obvious, Delia. Don’t be too
obvious. We all know that. That is what made
me ask about it. That is what it is, of course.
Well, I shall have a very fair idea of what to say
when we go to that prize-giving.”

As he returned from the prize-giving Mr. Bentley
spoke.

“This wind makes exceedingly trying walking.
We never seem to be without it now.”

“We do have it very often. I hope the boys
will think to put on their coats to come home.”

“Oh, from that school? I expect that Merry will
wrap them up, and watch them out of sight, to see
{87}they do not step in the puddles. That is the sort
of thing they are accustomed to there, I think.”

Delia was silent.

“I wish I could find a school for them more like
the one I was sent to as a boy.”

“I do not think Mr. Merry is as easy-going with
them as he seems. I think that is just his little
way.”

“I was not speaking of his being easy-going, or
about his little way. I was thinking of his being
such an unmitigated nincompoop. Such talk as his
no sane man would credit, if he did not hear it
with his ears. It is enough to ruin a boy to listen
to it.”

“Mrs. Merry is a nice woman,” said Delia.

“What difference does it make, whether she is
a nice woman or not? That does not teach the boys,
or help them to earn their living. And I do not
know if Miss Herrick is a nice woman. I should
think not. But I do know that she does not do
either.”

They entered the house in silence.

“Whatever on earth are those boys doing?
Palavering about, handing cups to people they have
never seen! They are fonder of waiting on strangers
than on their father.”

“They have to do it, Father. They do not enjoy
it.”

“Do not enjoy it! It is the only sort of thing
that John does enjoy. I wish I had sons more like
myself.”

The boys came in.

{88}“Oh, we have had the prize-giving! Harry has
got his prize. We had to hand round the tea.”

“You spent a very long time in handing round
tea. I spoke to Mr. Merry about you both. He had
not much to say for you.”

“And you seem to have a great many friends at
that school, as far as I can judge. Giggling, and
talking, even while the prizes were being given
away! It does not look as if you had no friends to
ask to your home, as always seems to be the case,
when I ask you why you do not bring them here,
and let us have an idea what kind of people you
are with, when you are away from us all day at such
an expense. There are very few of them who have
been brought up as you have; I am sure of that.
Anyone would think you would be proud to let them
see your father and your sister and your
surroundings. I can’t think what makes you so affected and
self-conscious about it. Now, once for all, what is
it?”

“Well, do not speak, then, do not speak. Go
off to your own employment, and settle down by
yourselves; and do not say a word to your father,
who makes sacrifices all day, that you may have
every advantage; and was trying to arrange
something else, that you might have further pleasure.
Go away then, and do not speak. Behave as my
children always do. Go away, without a word, to
your own concerns.”

{89}## Chapter VI

“I hope, Uncle Peter,” said Francis, “that
Mr. Herrick and Mr. Bumpus will excuse me for
not being present at their literary inauguration. I
have very little time to myself, and I am obliged to
deny myself all recreative reading, and being read
to must be counted under that head, I think. So, if
you will make my apologies to the authors, I will
leave you before they come in. Though I admit it
hardly seems fair to deny myself as audience, as I
am safe in that way myself. We clergymen have
an unfair advantage.”

“Yes, the poor laity!” said Miss Lydia.

“The arrangement was just for Peter and me to
hear the books,” said Theresa.

“Yes, yes,” said Francis, in a kindly voice.
“Then I may betake myself with a clear conscience
to the solid pursuits which must be my portion,
I fear.”

“I too must go to my solid pursuits,” said Miss
Lydia. “But the dear men things! How interested
they have been in it all!”

“Well, listeners never hear good of themselves,”
said Bumpus, coming in.

“But they don’t often hear anything as bad as
that,” said Emily. “What are we to say? People
{90}don’t speak about their own kindness, and of course
it is kindness in Dickie and Nicholas to be going to
read their books to us.”

“Ah, yes, yes, it is all for us,” said Miss Lydia.
“And we must not underrate the pleasure things.”

“Well, we shall not overrate them,” said Herrick.

“Could we overrate things of that kind?” said
Emily. “Well, are you going boldly to begin, or
am I to work at leading up to it? I couldn’t expect
anyone else to do that. Peter admires you too
much, and Lydia not nearly enough, and William
and Theresa are above leading up to things.”

“Well, well, we might begin,” said Herrick.

“Yes, yes, begin, Herrick,” said Bumpus.

“Yes, it is your business, dear,” said Emily.
“Dickie is a relative, and has to be put last in
everything. It would be presuming upon your
intimacy with the house to hold back.”

“It is so nice to help in any way,” said Miss
Lydia.

“I said that Lydia did not admire you nearly
enough,” said Emily.

“She really admires us terribly little,” said
Bumpus.

“Well, she has killed any desire in me, but to do
my simple best in anything I may undertake,” said
Herrick, opening his papers.

“Yes, we must keep Lydia here. She will put the
right spirit into it,” said Bumpus.

“Oh, no, no, I can’t be here. But it is so nice
to be wanted, thank you, thank you. So nice to go
off to what calls me most, feeling that I should be
{91}welcome at what calls me less, calls me too, though
it does not need me. For it does call me. It does
call me. But I must go to the need.”

“I am so proud of you for writing the book,
Nicholas,” said Emily, “and especially for going to
be known to have written it. And so remorseful for
thinking you might not be great, when you always
hinted. But the great always forgive.”

“Well, well,” said Herrick. “It came to me,
you know, that night when we sat up in turns with
old Crabbe. The whole thing came upon me, just
through that little service to somebody else.”

“It was really too much reward,” said Emily.
“But of course you deserved it.”

“Why, Bumpus,” said Herrick, looking at
Bumpus’ papers over his shoulder; “your
beginning sentence is the same as mine!”

“The same as yours?” said Bumpus. “Why,
it can’t be. It can’t be, surely. Why, there
wouldn’t be anything in common in our books.”

“Dickie, don’t say out what is in your mind
openly to Nicholas,” said Emily.

“Why, what is there in an opening sentence?”
said Herrick. “All opening sentences are much on
a line, aren’t they? All books have got to begin.”

“Nicholas, you have had faith in yourself,” said
Emily. “Do let us get it over. Anyhow, you
have one sentence as good as Dickie. So let us
have the beginning. That may be the only part we
can bear.”

“Yes, get on, Herrick,” said Bumpus. “Your
book is ready to the word, and mine isn’t. You are
{92}a greater than I. You have your own mind in
hand.”

“I have sympathy with boasting,” said Emily.
“I hope Nicholas has.”

“Yes, it is ready, Bumpus, it is ready,” said
Herrick. “It may be the last and only thing, but
something it is at last. You may all like to remember
the day, when you heard it from my own lips.”

“But don’t spoil it for me by reminding me that
I may be without a breadwinner,” said Emily;
“especially as you don’t win any bread. Dickie is
not doing things like that. I think I have proposed
to you, Dickie. But we haven’t time to go on about
it now.”

“Mine is not such a one as this one,” said
Bumpus. “I have had some delay with it. I left
it in old Crabbe’s room that night he died; and it
was got rid of with the other things. Crabbe’s illness
brought on your novel, Herrick, but it held back
mine. But it is the better for the re-writing of it.”

“Old Crabbe’s room? That night he died?”
said Herrick. “Did you leave your book in the
room, did you say, Bumpus? Ah, yes, it was a sad
night, that, for us. Good old Crabbe! I always
wondered that he never wrote. I have often said it.
Did you leave your book in the room, did you say,
Bumpus?”

“He never wrote. Not a line,” said Bumpus.
“He was of the different kind. Yes, I left my only
copy of it in the room, the typed copy; I always tear
up manuscript; and it was cleared away with the
other things. And re-writing it has meant re-working
{93}at it. You must make the best of it. I find I
don’t take up writing again so easily. My best went
into that early thing. Well, I have told my tale.
That is the better thing, there where it is. Not that
that matters now.”

“Couldn’t you write the early one again?” said
Emily, keeping her face turned from her brother.
“You could make it come back to you. A book
when it is written could hardly go. William and
I are the only people Nicholas has no influence over.
It makes me admire Nicholas, but not you.”

“Well, does one do that thing?” said Bumpus.
“Having done the other. Besides, that sort of
thing comes and goes, and then exists of itself, if it
has got on paper. But I confess I should like to be
able to bring it out, and have the credit of it.”

“Exists of itself when it has got on paper!” said
Emily. “It was as good as that, was it? Then I
wish you could have the credit of it.”

“Perhaps somebody could really begin to read it,”
said Mr. Fletcher.

“Perhaps it could read itself,” said Theresa.

“Emily, Emily!” said Herrick. “Please
forgive this sister of mine, Bumpus. She quite puts me
off reading my own book to-day. She does indeed.
We will just have yours. Anyhow, we will have
yours first. Yours is not finished, so anything we
don’t like in it, we shall think is not going to be
there. So it is easier for you.”

“Why should the first be last, and the last first?”
said Bumpus. “Mine will not bear hearing as
yours will. My real book is where we know it is.”

{94}“Why, yours will do as well, Dickie,” said
Emily. “Much better, I am afraid. You can see
that Nicholas is too frightened to read his, now that
the moment comes. And perhaps it is a good sign.
Good writers always feel a great wave of depression
about their work: and Nicholas’ symptoms were so
bad. Yours are all right now.”

“Well, well, then, I will start,” said Bumpus.
“But I wish it were not this book that I was
reading.”

“Richard,” said Masson, in a quick,
expressionless voice, “you know that copy of your other book,
that you gave to me once, when you thought it was
too illegible to be used? I think now is the time to
tell you that I kept it. I put it by, before...when
there was no question of the book’s not coming out.
And then I did not feel sure in taking on myself to
destroy it. So I have it, if you can use it.”

“You have it? You kept the copy? That copy
I gave you all those years ago, that I was going to
burn? Oh, I remember now. You had not read it,
had you? We were going to put it on the fire
without your reading it?”

“I did not read it then,” said Masson. “I
seldom read any but scientific books, as you know,
even my friends’ books. I did not even in those
days. But when it was to go, I read it; to have my
own impression of something of yours. I knew I
had been at liberty to read it. And then I could not
feel sure in destroying it. I should not have spoken
of it, had you not expressed a wish for it, and I had
provided for it to be burned at my death. I may
{95}seem to have taken much on myself. But I was
helpless. I felt I could do nothing else.”

There was a silence.

“Oh, well, I will look over it again,” said Bumpus.
“It may not be what I thought. But it is good
news to me in a way. Thank you, William, thank
you. I will try to use it, indeed. I will let this one
go by for the time, and get the other out as soon as
possible. After all, it is foolish not to change my
mind when I have really changed it. And I have
shown you all that I have done that.”

“Yes, even William,” said Emily. “And it is
such an opportunity for being above
self-consciousness and convention and other things. It would be
dreadful to waste it.”

“Well, I will not waste it,” said Bumpus. “I
would rather work on the other book. I couldn’t
deal with the two at once. I dare say it isn’t as good
as I thought. I was greatly younger then. But I
don’t feel I could go against you, William. Or
myself either. And I won’t read this one to-day.
This book will go to the wall for some time to come.
Who ever had so good a friend?”

“And I won’t read mine,” said Herrick. “I too
will wait for a future day. It wouldn’t be a good
thing now. I shouldn’t take any interest in it,
myself. My congratulations, my congratulations,
Bumpus. I am glad, glad for you. I think you
will always be the man of letters of us. I feel
doubts about my own book after all. I feel a great
wave of doubt about it. I believe I shall not have
it finished for a spell of time, I believe I shall
{96}be like Crabbe, a man that all his friends think
ought to write, and who never does. But I hope that
like him, I shall encourage my friends.”

“No, no, no. What reason is there in this?”
said Mr. Fletcher. “Why should we be baulked of
the present books? You can read yours, surely,
Richard, and then go on and finish it, before you
get on to the other. And we must hear yours,
Herrick; if not now, at some time very soon.
Whatever has come to both of you?”

“I couldn’t read this one to-day,” said Bumpus.
“William has put me off it, thrown me right back
from it. I couldn’t get the other out of my head.
I must go straight on to it. I am on it at this
moment, in my mind. I shan’t be on this one again
until the other is done. And it may have to be
remodelled then, in the light of the old one. A man
can’t do his own books entirely apart. I may have
got some of the one into the other. The old one was
so much a part of myself. But I dare say it isn’t so
much good, really. I took things hard when I was
young. Well, well, let us leave it all alone. How
patient you all are! I must be getting away.”

“What insight we are getting into the minds of
writers!” said Emily. “No wonder they are not
much good at things that can’t so well be held up.
Dickie and Nicholas have both proved that they are
authors at heart. But what they are in any other
way, we are not to know yet. Nicholas, you must
work some more at your book, to make up for not
having an extra one from your youth. It is such a
pity you haven’t one. It makes you so inferior to
{97}Dickie now, and it left you so much time then for
other things.”

“Oh, I think I shall leave my books to chance,
and interest myself in Richard’s,” said Herrick.

“But are we not to have the books?” said
Masson.

“You are not the one to complain,” said Emily.
“You have had one of Dickie’s books to yourself,
and no one else has had anything at all. And
don’t be out of sympathy with the erraticisms of
genius, because no one should be too far removed
from it.”

“We are carrying it off very shamelessly,” said
Bumpus.

“Are you?” said Emily. “That always seems
to me the one thing authors are not, shameless.
I think it would be better and safer for you to go, for
fear we might bring it home to you. Peter and
William were trying.”

“Two books in the hand, and now one in the
bush,” said Theresa.

“Theresa, you are really the only genius here,”
said Emily. “Genius is spontaneous, and the
genius of Dickie and Nicholas doesn’t seem to be
that. You had better go home, Nicholas dear, and
leave Dickie and William on your way. You want
a rest, and you can’t get that with greatness about.
Dickie is great intellectually, and William morally.
Moral greatness is the best, though I have always
wondered if that was true. And I am going to talk
to Theresa. Peter will walk with all of you, won’t
you, Peter?”

{98}“Isn’t it your birthday to-day, dear?” said
Theresa, as the two women were left alone.

“Yes, so it is,” said Emily. “That is why I
am out of spirits. I am fifty-one; and I don’t like
getting to have so little life left. And yet I don’t
much like living, which is absurd, and makes it
impossible for things to be planned for me; because
what can be done?”

“You don’t like living, dear?” said Theresa.

“No,” said Emily. “Of course I don’t like it.
This has been the worst birthday of all the fifty.”

“What is it? What is it all?” said Theresa.
“I see something, and yet I don’t know quite what
to see.”

“Oh, Theresa,” said Emily. “Did you see?
Did you see? Nobody else saw? The men didn’t
see? I always thought I had a man’s mind, but I
must have a woman’s instinct after all. At any
other time I should be ashamed of that.”

“You have nothing to be ashamed of, dear.”

“No, but Nicholas has not much,” said Emily.
“Why shouldn’t he have a book, when Mr. Crabbe
was dead and didn’t want it? Dickie found that a
book wasn’t any good to a dead friend. After thirty
years of thinking about it, he found that. And what
was Dickie doing, leaving a book about, when
Nicholas wanted one so much, and couldn’t make
one for himself? And Dickie knew he couldn’t.
He always unkindly never deceived Nicholas about
it.”

“Mr. Crabbe?” said Theresa. “Mr. Crabbe?
I only half understand yet. Was the book Mr.
{99}Crabbe’s? I thought it was Richard who left the
book in the room? Oh, your brother thought the
book was Mr. Crabbe’s? Oh, I see now. I thought
he did not guess whose it was. I see now. I see.”

“Yes, that is it, I am sure,” said Emily. “But
do you see the other thing? Did you see about
Dickie? That book that he left in the room, that
he had to write again, was the same as his early
book, that was buried with his friend! I believe it
was. I am certain it was. Did you feel that, when
William and he were talking? He couldn’t begin
his book, because William had read it. Of course I
am not sure. But then I am. That is why Dickie
is putting it away for the time. It is a good thing
the book did not begin to read itself, as you said.”

“Oh!” said Theresa. “There was only one
book, then? All three were the same book? Your
brother’s and Richard’s, and the other of Richard’s
that William kept? They were all just Richard’s
old book?”

“Yes,” said Emily. “It sounds clever of Dickie,
doesn’t it? You wouldn’t think one book would
have to go so far. Dickie and Nicholas were both
wonderful about managing things. You wouldn’t
think they would find books so difficult. Poor
Nicholas wanted a book so. And he knew Mr.
Crabbe was dying and friendless, so that no one
could have read his book. And it was typed, so
that he couldn’t tell it by the handwriting. He
thought it out so cleverly. Of course it makes it
much worse of him. But perhaps he forgot all
that. Criminals do forget something.”

{100}“It was a shame!” said Theresa. “So you
think that Richard remembered his book, and wrote it
again? And then again, after your brother
had—had taken it?”

“Yes,” said Emily. “He had a lot of trouble,
hadn’t he? But it was his own book. That seems
quite good and strange of him. And worth the
trouble, really. He was always saying how his
book went back to his youth. He almost told us.
He was really rather honest, considering everything.
And William had read the book, which isn’t like
William. That must have been put into William’s
heart. Because of course Dickie wasn’t doing quite
rightly.”

“Suppose any one of them had begun to read
it,” said Theresa.

“Oh, I was afraid you would begin to suppose
that! To read *it!* How dreadfully you realize the
thing! And your sinister notion that the book
might begin to read itself! I believe in religion
now, and about our never being given to bear what
is beyond our strength. Anyhow we shouldn’t be
on our birthday. If it had happened, Nicholas and
Dickie and William and I, and Peter—but does
Peter know?—could never have met again. And we
none of us know anyone else.”

“Peter does not know,” said Theresa, firmly.
“What a thing for your brother that you have never
married, dear! But I have often thought you would
both be happier. Your brother married, as well.”

“Nicholas and I happier married! You don’t
think, Theresa. Wives can’t think. Married
{101}people reveal all their past to each other, don’t they?
Peter must have had a lovely past. Nicholas
couldn’t do that. He hadn’t ever a good past, not
at marriageable age. And he certainly couldn’t
now. And he is seventy. He would have to marry
an old lady. And she would not like the noise of
the school. And it would really be taking advantage
of Mr. Merry, because old ladies have so many little
extra wants.”

“Does William suspect anything about the
books?” said Theresa.

“No, they none of them saw anything. Even
Dickie and Nicholas each thought he was the only
bad one. But they had enough to think of. So I
know for certain that I could never marry William.
For I find that I only like wickedness and
penetration.”

“Shall you tell your brother that you know?
Does he know you know?” said Theresa.

“I shall tell him nothing. If he thinks I know,
or may know, we just shall not speak of it. Then
that will be the same to him as my not knowing.
Nicholas is like that. And what is adorable about
him is, that he would think no less of Dickie. He
never despises baseness. That is why it is so right
of him to be base. I should appreciate him better,
and owe him more, if I were more base.”

“No, it isn’t much good to you, dear.”

“No,” said Emily. “That is what I am saying.
It hasn’t been quite fair to Nicholas.”

“Shall you tell him about Richard? Does he
suspect?”

{102}“I think he is not subtle enough, and was too
absorbed in his own affairs. No wonder. Of course
I shall not tell him. It is no business of mine. I
am not even sure. I ought not to have said a word
to you. I knew you couldn’t really know. They
are none of them as base as me. I am quite a chance
for Nicholas, if only he knew. But you won’t say a
word, Theresa? Not a word.”

“Oh, no, dear,” said Theresa.

“I think I can trust you,” said Emily. “I know
you don’t mind that kind of wickedness. So why
should you reveal it?”

“What an extraordinary thing that they didn’t
give themselves away!” said Theresa. “It all fell
about in such a minute, too. It almost seems as if
something must have been there to prevent it.”

“Hardly anything providential,” said Emily.
“They couldn’t be thought to deserve that. But
you and I certainly didn’t deserve its being spun out.
Nicholas was afraid to read a thing that he couldn’t
have written. Because of course he couldn’t have
written Dickie’s book. He was always leading up
to the shock of it. And it was natural for Dickie
to tell us that he had had to re-write his book. All
that re-writing would have to make an impression.
It was really unlucky that he hadn’t told us before.
Things always happen so hardly on Nicholas.”

“But Richard might have begun to read his
book,” said Theresa. “It was only William who
by chance prevented him.”

“Yes,” said Emily. “If we are to persist in
thinking unproved evil of Dickie, and of course we
{103}are to do that. That must have been providential,
and I told you I had got religion from it. So
organic too, for William to prevent it, when it was
only he, who made the prevention necessary!
William couldn’t have been so egotistic by himself.
This may have happened to convince you how far
he and I are from each other. Providential things
seem to be circuitous, like that.”

“I can’t think why Richard couldn’t have said
that his book was the old one,” said Theresa.

“When one book was so much above the average,
too,” said Emily. “But he didn’t know it was.
He thought it was being just equal to Nicholas, and
that has never done for Dickie. Did you see the
shock he had in thinking one sentence was the same?
I wish my shock had only been that. And then
there was going back on what he had done. That
was the trouble. Knowing William would make that
very difficult.”

“I don’t know why he should want two kinds of
credit,” said Theresa. “Not Richard.”

“That is beautiful of you towards him,” said
Emily. “Why shouldn’t he want two kinds of
credit? You wouldn’t ask that if you lived with
Nicholas. Living with Peter must be so ennobling.
There are Lydia and Peter coming up the road. It
is nice to see Peter in innocent company again. I
can’t meet them, Theresa. I am going home to
write it all in my diary. I keep a diary, because I
think I have that kind of personality. I must put in
my will that it is to be destroyed at my death. For
fear somebody should read it, and publish it, and
{104}pretend they had written it. Unless I leave it to
Nicholas, so that he can have written a book after
all. I hope he will outlive me. I would commit
suicide, except that now I believe in religion, and
religion does not allow that. And I am not single
for the sake of Nicholas. I read in a book that no
woman could love a man she did not make sacrifices
for. But there is so much falseness about books.
Too much, I think.”

“Emily is worth a thousand Lydias,” said
Theresa, as her husband entered the study alone.

“Oh, you are too wise to talk of some people in
terms of others, my dear. Emily is rare, of course.”

“Oh, you see that, do you, Peter?”

“Yes, I see that, my dear. I see.”

Theresa looked at her husband, and did not speak.

Emily went back to her brother, and found him
sitting by his fire, dreamy and unoccupied.

“Well, darling,” she said. “So you have given
up your book! Have you done away with it?”

“Yes, I have destroyed it,” said Herrick, smiling
at her. “Destroyed it, my Emily. I don’t like
books, and that is the truth. I am quite put off them.
Do you know, dear old Bumpus made a confession
to Masson and me? He confessed that he had
remembered his old book, called it up to his mind
again, the one that was supposed to be in his friend’s
grave, that is actually there; and made out that it
was this new one. This one he was to have read
to-night. The one that was destroyed in old
Crabbe’s room. And to own that up before Masson
and Fletcher! I couldn’t have done it, Emily.
{105}And I don’t think it is incumbent upon a man to
keep nothing of his secret doings to himself.”

“Neither do I,” said Emily. “We should be
afraid of having anybody talk to us. And we
certainly couldn’t talk to anybody. I don’t mean it
wasn’t wonderful of Dickie. But what he had done
wasn’t enough to be a tax on anybody. For his
very worst.”

“No,” said Herrick. “There was no great harm
in it. But I confess I don’t readily follow a stretch
of doubleness like that. A sudden temptation and
yielding to it! That I understand. I think the
highest type of person might be prone to it.”

“Everyone can understand that,” said Emily.
“And the lowest type of person would be even more
prone to it. But everything else just follows from it.
That does want a little more cleverness to
understand, or else experience. But I am sure you
understand it, darling. Did William and Peter say
anything?”

“They neither of them said a word,” said Herrick.
“But they will not in the future. It is all over for
Bumpus. Well, I don’t like books, to bring old
Bumpus to that. Dear old Bumpus! It was a fine
thing of him, when he was a young man, and a
fine thing of him now to tell us of it. He told us
to tell you, Emily. He remembered your making
the suggestion that he should re-write the book. It
was not easy to him, I think, to have you told. I
think he found me the easiest. And I confess I like
to think that.”

“So should I,” said Emily. “You were rather
{106}unkind about me. I suppose I have proved that I
should have done the same in Dickie’s place. I
don’t know why he should find me difficult.”

“Dear old Bumpus!” said Herrick. “My dear
old gifted, erring friend! Well, well, we all err.
And this kind of thing, this literary ambition, is the
thing that most of all leads men to error, I think.
Do you know, Emily, I think that the best
achievement of a man, the highest and largest thing, is to
feel tolerance and generous love for a man who can
do what is denied to himself to do. I do indeed. As
I feel for Bumpus to-night. As I feel for my friend.
I do indeed feel it, Emily.”

“Nicholas, you really are a genius,” said Emily.

{107}## Chapter VII
“Miss Basden, just come and put a stop to all this,
will you? Here is Mother, getting all into a state,
with nobody thought of coming! I wish this
dinner-party was at the bottom of the sea. Just see
that she gets a breathing space, Miss Basden, will
you?”

“Yes, I will, Mr. Merry. I have got fairly tidy
myself betimes, on purpose to prevent such
naughtiness,” said Miss Basden, who wore a remote
expression, for which her toilet was responsible.

“Yes, Miss Basden, how we depend on you!
And what a thing, all of this! All this fuss and
change, and nobody coming who can do any good
to the school! All this pretending that we do not
live as we do, but in different rooms, and in a
different way, as if the ordinary way did not make
work enough! A second rate kind of thing, I call
it, for all of us to be doing. And it isn’t as if Miss
Herrick will not give us away, so that all of it is as
good as nothing——Ah, Miss Herrick! Ah, I did
not see you, Miss Herrick. We were just saying
how you would give us away, you know, and talk
as you will to us, so that our guests would see
through all our little changes. Ah, Miss Herrick,
{108}you and I both have our way of talking, haven’t
we?”

“Yes, I am sure we have everything due to us.
And it is so suitable for you not to like the second
rate. But I am afraid the basement dining-room is
that. I believe Mr. Bentley would think so. We
ought to be going to the study, which is the
drawing-room to-night. We have honestly left that as it is.”

Miss Basden hurried across the hall to open the
door for Emily, and Mr. Merry followed as if too
cast down to take this natural office upon himself.

“What a lovely family group!” said Emily, as
the Fletchers came in. “An uncle and a nephew,
and a brother and a sister and an aunt, and a husband
and a wife, and I think some more, all in four people!
I wish Nicholas and I were something to Mr. and
Mrs. Merry and Miss Basden.”

“Ah, you are, Miss Herrick, you are,” said
Mr. Merry.

“And am I to be left out? That is very lonely
for me,” said Mr. Burgess.

“Yes, yes, Mr. Burgess,” said Mr. Merry.
“Why, Mr. Bentley! How are you, Mr. Bentley?
Why, how nice it is to have one of the fathers of our
laddies here among us, like this!”

“Let us go up to the fire, Miss Bentley,” said
Mrs. Merry, “and leave the men to talk about the
newspapers in the cold.”

“Why, what a way for your wife to talk in your
presence, Mr. Merry!” said Delia.

“I don’t suppose wives ought to talk at all in their
husbands’ presence,” said Herrick.

{109}“Civilized countries are so artificial,” said Emily.
“But you should not speak true words in jest,
Nicholas. It is not open of you.”

“Well, what about us single women, Miss
Herrick?” said Miss Basden.

“Well, I don’t suppose we ought to talk at all.
I expect we ought to be exposed at birth, or
something like that.”

“How would it be known at birth which of us
were going to be single?” said Delia.

“That is really clever of you,” said Emily.
“Though people exposed at birth would be single,
wouldn’t they?”

“Well, we were certainly classed by the state with
paupers and idiots and children, before we had the
vote,” said Miss Basden. “I mean we women
were.”

“And no nice children, or paupers either, and no
really sensible idiots, would talk in people’s
presence,” said Bumpus.

“Do we go in to dinner now, and pair off like the
ark?” said Emily. “I think that is so useful. How
clever of you, Nicholas, to have told everybody to
take in everybody else, without telling them
anything! But then men are clever.”

“Do you really think, Miss Herrick,” said
Francis, as the seats were taken, “that men are
clever in such little ways, compared to ladies? I
think many people would grant the ladies the palm.”

“I won’t answer for my sister, Fletcher,” said
Herrick. “She will be leading you into danger.
You would soon find yourself in her power.”

{110}“I should never be anything but glad, Mr.
Herrick,” said Francis, leaning forward, “to find
myself in any lady’s power.”

“That is rather a rash statement,” said Mr.
Burgess. “I haven’t lived so long as many of the
people here, but I should hardly say that.”

“Ah, Mr. Burgess, so you have seen life, have
you?” said Mr. Merry.

“I have seen life, Merry,” said Bumpus. “Do
please believe me.”

“We won’t talk about that, Richard,” said
Herrick.

“Nicholas is going to be a bright host!” said
Emily. “Isn’t he wonderful?”

“How are your little fellows to-night, Miss
Bentley?” said Mr. Merry. “They are growing,
you know. We can’t stop that; and we don’t want
to; but we have to keep an eye on them.”

“Francis, listen,” said Bumpus. “You are the
only possible future parent in the room. Bentley’s
boys are here.”

Mr. Merry faintly sighed, as if he had indeed been
working merely from habit; and Mr. Bentley looked
up, as though he could see no occasion for himself
to speak.

“It must be so nice to have a houseful of boys,”
said Miss Lydia. “Boys and men are my province.
Now, your woman is a complex creature. I don’t
seem to get any hold upon her. It is just meant to
show us, that we are all meant for different parts of
what has to be done.”

“I gather, Miss Basden, that I am not on what
{111}you would call the side of the chosen,” said Francis,
with his careful laugh. “I plead guilty to
disagreeing with you on the woman’s suffrage
question.”

“I think that these changes in the divorce laws
will do a great deal towards equalizing the position
of women,” said Miss Basden, with terseness and
rising colour.

“Miss Basden,” said Francis, after a startled
pause, “I should think any man unworthy of the
name, who did not feel the old laws a crying disgrace
to a civilized country; as you are brave enough to
face these subjects. But I confess I should
sympathize with you, if you preferred to turn your eyes
from them.”

“Well, I should not sympathize with myself. I
don’t think that, because people are safe from the
married dangers, they should turn their eyes from
others who are not.”

“You will all have your patience tried, if you go
on,” said Herrick.

“But I expect they would all keep it,” said Delia,
implying that this was a grave necessity.

“I do not know that, Miss Bentley,” said Francis.
“I am afraid I must confess that I yield rather easily
to impatience.”

“Well, well, it is the same thing,” said Herrick.
“The one is a condensed form of the other. Patience
contains more impatience than anything else, as I
judge.”

“You judge well,” said Bumpus.

“How profound you are, Nicholas!” said Emily.
{112}“I have always thought that. Though I have never
known that I thought it. Think how it is with
everything; how tolerance, for example, is only
condensed intolerance, and how it holds more intolerance
than anything else. It is just a case for intolerance
to be kept in. And think how religion holds more
dislike of religion than anything else!”

“Now, Uncle Peter, put them right,” said Francis.

“Well, well, I think myself,” said Mr. Fletcher,
“that the old, simple views are the right ones; that
patience is as far as can be from impatience, tolerance
from intolerance, in a word, good from bad. I think
we all think that.”

“Yes, I think we do,” said Delia, gravely.

“I do not think so,” said Emily. “I think that
good is bad condensed. I think so, because my
brother has told me so. I think a woman ought to
think what the men of her family think. You think
that too, do you not, Francis? It is right of me to
think that good is bad condensed, and holds more
bad than anything else, when my brother thinks so,
isn’t it?”

“Ah! Miss Herrick,” said Francis, slowly shaking
his head.

“Mother, you are not eating,” said Mr. Merry.

“Look, what is that?” said Herrick, hurriedly,
pointing to a brooch which Miss Lydia wore. “A
most curious thing! A most beautiful piece of old
work! Let me see it. Be so very kind to me as to
take it off, and pass it to me. Yes; a most exquisite
thing of art, a possession for whoever owns it.”

“Oh, my brooch! Yes, I am very fond of my
{113}brooch. My dear brooch, that was given me by my
sailor-man, who came back to me, so shy and
awkward, dear, nice thing, to tell me that he had
thought of me! Oh, I would not part with my
brooch.”

“How beautiful it must be to have sailor-men and
brooches, and not feel that one’s death-bed must be
so remorseful!” said Emily.

“Ah, they are my children,” said Miss Lydia.

“You have no children, have you, Mr. Fletcher?”
said Delia, smiling.

“Not living,” said Mr. Fletcher. “We have
had two sons.”

Theresa gazed fiercely in front of her.

“Yes, there is not much good in rearing up
children, when they are to be killed off one by one.”

“It is the valuable lives that must be used,”
murmured Miss Lydia. “That is why they are so
precious. Ah! how precious they were!”

Mr. Fletcher looked at his women simply with
solicitude. He had no thought that strangers might
not have the knowledge of them, that a lifetime had
given himself.

“Mrs. Fletcher is very sensitive, is she not?” said
Delia to Francis.

“Yes, yes, she is,” said Francis. “She is the
most sensitive creature. My uncle has had great
trouble with her; to save her all that she could be
saved, I mean.” Francis hastened to contradict what
might be read into his words. “It is a great
responsibility to marry a good woman, and find that
she is so wrought upon by things.”

{114}“But she has been the very wife for him, I should
think?” said Delia.

“Miss Bentley,” said Francis, leaning forward,
she has been an angel to him.”

“Rather a substantial angel,” said Theresa.

“If that quality, Aunt Theresa, is not possible in
angels, I am afraid that we can none of us besides
Uncle Peter claim to have anything angelic about
us,” said Francis.

“Well, well, if we are as well as may be, as men
and women, that is enough,” said Mr. Fletcher,
implying that certain comparisons were not of a kind
to be made.

“Uncle Peter,” said Francis, “I thank you for
your rebuke. One is so prone to get into the way of
using lightly words that are to be used in a different
spirit. Any check on that is very wholesome, and
to me, very welcome.”

“I should not have thought that so many perfect
people would be allowed to live together in one
house,” said Bumpus.

“Yes, we have been allowed to live together for a
long time,” said Miss Lydia, her voice dwelling on
the agency. “It has been a happy, happy time.
But the end of all good things will come. We must
look for it. It is that, that makes them so good.
But we shall go on being happy. We have all so
much work to do.”

“We shall go on being happy, too,” said Miss
Basden. “We have plenty of work to do here as
well.”

“Yes, you have, Miss Basden,” said Mr. Merry.

{115}“Miss Basden, it is a thing to be so thankful for,”
said Francis, his tone correcting possible regret and
shame in Miss Basden, in earning her bread.

“Yes, yes, of course,” said Herrick. “We all
feel that in this house, I am sure. Why, I work
from early morning to late at night. And I never
take a holiday. I can’t see what people want with
holidays myself.”

“What do you say to that, Mr. Burgess?” said
Mr. Merry.

“Well, I was expecting that, Mr. Merry. We
have discussed that question, and understand each
other now on it, I think.”

Mr. Burgess opened the door for the women.

“Mr. Burgess is a beautiful advertisement,” said
Emily, as they reached the study. “He shows
almost an arrogance. Fancy having that for boys!”

“He has his points,” said Miss Basden.

“You are a martyr, Miss Basden,” said Emily.
“The worst of a beautiful advertisement is, that it
does need that.”

“Let us talk quickly about servants,” said Mrs.
Merry, smiling, “before the men come in.”

“It must be so dreadful to be a servant,” said
Emily, “and do the important work of the world.
That sort of work, so ill paid and degrading.”

“Well, well, it depends upon others. And women
vary so, vary so,” said Miss Lydia.

“Well, I do not really think it would be such a
bad life,” said Delia. “If I belonged to the working
class, I would rather be a servant than many other
things.”

{116}“And yet you don’t think it is a bad life,” said
Emily; “putting it like that! Fancy having to be
of nice appearance; and quick and willing and
trustworthy; and not wear spectacles waiting at table, as
if one’s sight would alter then!” Emily put up her
glass. “It must be very bad to be all that, or
anything except the first. And I have never met people
of that quality, except Peter and William. And they
are neither of them quick. And I am not sure of
Peter’s appearance.”

Theresa laughed.

“Well, now, Mr. Herrick, we have all been remiss
in not asking you when your book is coming out,”
said Francis, as the men came in. “A novel? Is
that what they call it? But when is your book
coming out, if I may put it in a safe way?”

“Oh, well, I believe very likely not at all.
Perhaps I have come to your implied view of it,”
said Herrick.

“Oh, well, I shouldn’t perhaps have put it in the
way I did. And what does my view have to do with
it? But I will confess that it did strike me as not a
quite expected thing, that you should give your time
to writing a book, that any lady might have written.
I don’t mean that a lady could write your book. You
won’t take me to mean what I don’t mean?”

“Mr. Fletcher, you are not blind, surely, to the
fact that women often equal and surpass men in
literary achievement?” said Miss Basden.

“Well, Miss Basden, I plead guilty to being
old-fashioned in these matters. It is my inclination to
put women on a plane of their own, and to regard
{117}them as coming down from it, when they take upon
themselves the things that have been held fitter for
men. And that perhaps leads to my implying that
they do not do so well in those things. But I was
meaning quite the opposite of disrespect to them, I
assure you.”

“Oh, I see. There is the usual kind of contempt
in that sentimental exaltation of women.”

“Miss Basden, believe me, it never has been so
with me,” said Francis, earnestly.

“If Francis should marry Miss Basden,” said
Emily to Theresa, “the school would go down just
as Nicholas begins to need the comforts of old age.
Unless he would live here with her.”

“He is good at living in other people’s houses,”
said Theresa.

“I suppose living with him would embitter one,”
said Emily.

“Suppose Merry should be embittered!” said
Bumpus. “His personality would go to pieces.”

“Miss Basden apologizes for being a spinster
rather more often than is necessary,” said Emily.
“Of course I don’t mean it is not necessary, up to
a point.”

“And his marrying her would put a stop to her
being self-supporting,” said Bumpus. “That is
what he does not like about her.”

“Where is my wife?” said Mr. Merry.

“She has run away and deserted us,” said Delia.

“She has gone up to sit for a few minutes in her
room, I think, Mr. Merry,” said Miss Basden,
stooping over the fire.

{118}“Is she not well?” said Herrick, loudly. “Allow
me, allow me, Miss Basden.”

“Yes, I think so, Mr. Herrick,” said Miss
Basden. “She just wanted a few minutes to herself,
as she does sometimes.”

“Not when she has guests!” said Herrick, still
rather loudly.

“Hers is a solitary nature, I suppose,” said Miss
Lydia, looking up.

“I think we owe this coffee to her,” said Masson,
as a tray was brought in, followed by Mrs. Merry.

“William, what a charming first word of the
evening for you to speak!” said Bumpus. “Giving
someone her due.”

“We are very grateful to her for it,” said Miss
Basden. “Coffee is a thing I never take on myself.
I plead guilty to managing it much less well than
Mrs. Merry.”

“I should like there to be no such thing as food,
myself,” said Mrs. Merry, leaning back in her chair.

“Yes, Mother,” said Mr. Merry.

Francis looked at Mrs. Merry with long and almost
inquiring sympathy.

“We must not ask our friends to dinner again,
must we, Merry?” said Herrick in a low tone,
breathing deeply.

“Oh, Mr. Herrick!” said Mr. Merry, leaning
towards him. “Oh, you are not right, you know.
Not if you take us up seriously, just when we are just
feeling a little for you, in this little disturbance. No,
no, not a disturbance, a pleasure for us all. Yes,
yes, we all know.”

{119}“I never can remember to eat, myself,” said Miss
Basden, in a tone that addressed the company. “If
I can remember, I always do, because I think one
can do so much more, if one eats.”

“Ah, Miss Basden,” said Mr. Merry, his voice
somehow dying away.

“Ah, the pleasures of our bodies!” said Miss
Lydia, with the last word lower. “They are given
to us as things that are right for us. If they are
used rightly. If they are used rightly.”

“Charles, have you finished your coffee, dear?”
said Mrs. Merry.

“Charles?” said Masson. “Oh, it is Merry’s
Christian name.”

“How simple and kindly of him it seems to have
one!” said Emily.

“A king’s name, too,” said Bumpus.

“Mrs. Merry, have you a name, apart from the
maternal one by which we hear you designated?”
said Mr. Burgess.

Mr. Merry’s eyes went to Mr. Burgess.

“Yes. My name is Emily,” said Mrs. Merry.

“My third name is Emily,” said Miss Basden.
“What a lot of namesakes we are!”

“Yes, Miss Basden; very nice,” said Mr. Merry,
his voice just avoiding a note of deprecation.

“And, Miss Basden, if I may ask, what are your
other two names?” said Francis.

Miss Basden repeated two names; and there was
a faint titter from one of the maids who were
removing the coffee table.

“Mother,” said Mr. Merry, throwing a fierce
{120}glance from habit towards the titter, and rapidly
withdrawing it; “what is it you were saying?”

“I hope Mrs. Merry will be quick, before
Miss Basden has a fourth name,” said Bumpus.
“Francis’ mind is working towards it. She did
not say she stopped at three.”

“Oh, didn’t she imply it?” said Emily. “The
kitchenmaid, who is second parlourmaid to-night,
must find it too much.”

“Isn’t it too much?” said Theresa.

“How good we all are at talking without ever
saying anything we think!” said Bumpus.

“It is not always politic to say what we think,”
said Miss Basden.

“It is not so easy,” said Masson.

“Sometimes I suppose it is right to say it,
whether or no we like it, and whether or no it is
liked,” said Delia.

“Yes, yes; the thing to be done,” said Miss
Lydia, sighing.

“Oh, just possibly. Once or twice in a lifetime,”
said Mr. Bentley to his daughter.

“Nearer once than twice,” said Bumpus.

“Oh, every one is not a man,” said Theresa.

“No, that would be a queer state of things,” said
Miss Basden.

“Yes,” said Bumpus. “Suppose there had
to be two under masters instead of you and
Burgess!”

“Oh, Mr. Bumpus!” said Miss Basden.

“Well, would two under mistresses do instead of
the two of us?” said Mr. Burgess, not feeling
{121}self-suppression a duty in this case. “Or is
prejudice the one thing regarded in this school?”

“No, no, Mr. Burgess. Come, you know it is
not,” said Mr. Merry. “You are the only sop to
it. I mean...what I meant was, Mr. Burgess,
that if it didn’t matter about having a man on the
staff, we should still have been glad to have you, you
know. That is what I meant, Mr. Burgess.”

“I meant that, too,” said Bumpus.

“Oh, well, Mr. Merry, you are very kind. But
it doesn’t sound as if you would have been much
good to me, much compensation to me, in the event
of my not being a man.”

Mr. Burgess noted Miss Basden’s expression, and
relapsed into peace.

“I should think you are all great readers,
Fletcher,” said Herrick. “Miss Fletcher, now, are
you not a great person for books?”

“Oh, my books! Yes, I am very fond of my
books,” said Miss Lydia. “My dear books, that
live in my special case! I love them very much.
I am always excited when I have a new companion
for them. Yes, I am a great person for my books.”

“Have you a particular kind?” said Herrick.

“Yes,” said Miss Lydia, raising her eyes without
lifting her head. “History! Nearly all my books
are historical; or if not, biographical. I should think
I have not read a novel for thirty years.”

“What books do you read most, Mr. Fletcher?”
said Delia, to Francis.

“Miss Bentley, the book I read the most, is, I am
thankful to say, the Old Book. My life is largely
{122}made up of what must be called the sordid things
of the world. But I have the one great privilege.”

“Yes, yes, we can all do with that book. A very
good book!” said Herrick.

“Miss Basden, what do you read?” said Emily.
“Only the Bible or not?”

“Well, I read a good deal of French, Miss
Herrick. I do not know how it is, but I always
enjoy books so much more, when they are in French.
I feel so much more at home in the language,
somehow. Now I very seldom read an English book.”

“How wonderful and educational for the boys of
you! But what kind of books do you read?”

“Oh, all kinds. I really do not mind, as long
as they are French. Or if not French, Italian or
German. What I do not like to read, is an English
book.”

“Well, Miss Basden, we can very few of us say
that,” said Francis.

“I believe I really read the Bible the most, too,”
said Delia.

“It is a good thing we did not all live in the time
when the Bibles were chained up in the churches,”
said Bumpus. “It would have been so lonely.”

“Well, but it is a good thing to read the Bible,”
said Francis.

“Of course it is the most beautiful book,” said
Emily. “And now we are modern, and only read
about wickedness, it is so nice to have it unchained,
isn’t it? It really ought to be chained, I think.”

“Ah, you try to get at us, Miss Herrick,” said
Francis, not quite checking a laugh.

{123}“Ah, there is much warning in it for us,” said
Miss Lydia.

“In all great pictures,” said Francis, firmly
pulling himself together, and finding the effort
inspiring; “we are shown the dreadful as well as
the beautiful. We are surely not given only one
side of the lesson.”

“I am one of the greatest readers alive,” said
Herrick. “I have read all European modern
literature, the enormous bulk of it. And I have
read as much mediaeval literature as any man
living. And I know my Greek and Latin. They
were taught us well when I was a boy.”

“But you need not imply how they are taught
now,” said Bumpus.

“What do you read, Mr. Masson?” said Mrs.
Merry.

“Very little off my own line, Mrs. Merry. Miss
Austen is the novelist I read the most.”

“What do you think of her books, Mr. Fletcher?”
said Delia to Francis.

“I am afraid, Miss Bentley, that I have very
little use for books written by ladies for ladies, if
I may so express myself; though I dare say I should
be the better for them.”

“Oh, no, you would not. You could not be,”
said Bumpus.

“It is the other way round,” said Masson.

“Personally, I can’t get over the littleness in her
books,” said Miss Basden.

“Ah, we are not small enough, not small enough,”
said Miss Lydia.

{124}“The best goods are done up in a certain way,”
said Mr. Fletcher, smiling.

“It is my great regret that Jane Austen died so
young,” said Masson.

“And one used to think that forty odd was not
so young after all,” said Herrick.

“I never think about my age,” said Miss
Basden.

“Ah, but we are in progress,” breathed Miss
Lydia, “simply in progress.”

“To what may be big enough in the end for us,”
said Theresa.

“One is really a hero for not committing suicide,
I suppose,” said Mr. Burgess.

“Now, Mr. Burgess, none of that sort of talk with
the boys,” said Mr. Merry.

“Oh, I very seldom talk to the boys, Mr. Merry.”

“I hope no one has seen me talking to my
undergraduates,” said Bumpus.

“No one has. Don’t boast, Dickie,” said Emily.

“We must be going,” said Theresa.

“So must we,” said Delia. “We ought to be
quite ashamed of staying so long, oughtn’t we,
Father?”

“It has been too great a pleasure for us to feel
compunction about seeming to appreciate it,” said
Mr. Bentley, his voice falling with an unfamiliar
sound.

“Thank you for coming and bearing it all,” said
Emily. “It has been a great thing for us to have
such glimpses of family life. My brother and I are
orphans, you know.”

{125}“And I am half an orphan,” said Mr. Burgess.
“So it is very suitable all round.”

“Now, look here, Mr. Burgess,” said Mr. Merry,
in a low tone, “there is no need for you to be
standing about, saying good-bye to everyone, you
know. Now suppose you go off somewhere to have
a smoke, you know.”

“Good-bye, Mr. Fletcher.” Mr. Merry took
upon himself the duties of host. “No more prizes
yet for you to give away. The lads like to work
for their rewards, bless them. And Mr. Bentley.
Ah, the two boys! I won’t tell you now what we
think of them, because that must be kept for a day
when we have had less pleasure.”

Mr. Merry returned to the sitting-room, rubbing
his hands, and looking about him with much
fondness, as if using up the residue of the feelings
gathered for his guests.

“Well, we shall start off work to-morrow with
quite a spurt,” said Miss Basden.

“Yes, Miss Basden,” said Mr. Merry. “Not
that you are in much need of that.”

“Well, but it is an opportunity for you to get a
hit at me, Mr. Merry,” said Mr. Burgess, strolling
back into the room.

“Oh, Mr. Burgess! Get a hit at you! Why,
you try to misunderstand me, unless you like to be
treated as if you were seventy. Good night, Miss
Herrick. And Mr. Herrick. Yes, Mr. Burgess.
Are you coming up with us? Such a pleasure to us
all. Not at all a trouble. I mean, what a pleasure
in proportion to the little arranging, you know.”

{126}Mr. Merry hastened after his wife, as if fearing to
break his impression.

“Well, I have not much to boast of,” said
Herrick, sitting down by the fire. “Seventy years
old, and nothing before me, and nothing behind to
count! Why, I could almost envy Merry, for being
only fifty, and wanting nothing more than he has.”

“You should not talk about ‘almost envying’
Mr. Merry, as if he belonged to people like that,”
said Emily. “And I don’t know about his not
wanting more than he has. I don’t think he wants that
much. And fifty isn’t such a good age as all that.
And not much to boast of! With seventy years of
safe life behind you, when most people have the risk
of having so much less! And all the life in front of
you, that people of seventy always have!”

“Yes, yes, Emily. I dare say I shall have a time
yet. Time to do something in. It sometimes
happens that the end of a man’s life sums him up.
There is no great wrong about being an exception.
Exceptions are more worthy of interest in a way. I
don’t think I have ever been quite on the ordinary
line.”

“No, I am sure you have not. It would have been
dreadful of you.”
